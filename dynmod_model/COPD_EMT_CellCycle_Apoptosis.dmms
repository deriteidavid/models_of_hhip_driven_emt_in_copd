NodeDescription: {\color{NavyBlue} The interstitial ECM of alveoli is composed of a relaxed mesh, dominated by type I and III collagens and elastin \cite{burgstallerInstructiveExtracellularMatrix2017}. Here we assume that these ECM components are secreted by tissue-resident fibroblasts into the connective tissue surrouding the alveolar basement membrane of alveolar type I and type II epithelial cells \cite{burgstallerInstructiveExtracellularMatrix2017}, and treat the \textit{COL1\_3} node as an environmental input. Complete absence of either the basement membrane (\textit{Basement\_Membrane} node) or \textit{COL1\_3} represents a scenario where the epithelial cells cannot form any ECM attachments (loss of anchorage; equivalent to the \textit{ECM} = OFF and \textit{Stiff\_ECM} = OFF input in our \cite{sullivanBooleanModelingMechanosensitive2023} model).}
NodeNotes: "The extracellular matrix (ECM) supports lung tissue architecture and physiology by providing mechanical stability and elastic recoil. Over the last several decades, it has become increasingly clear that the stiffness of the ECM governs many cellular processes, including cell-phenotype and functions during development, healing, and disease. Of all the lung ECM proteins, collagen-I is the most abundant and provides tensile strength. In many fibrotic lung diseases, the expression of collagen is increased which affects the stiffness of the surrounding environment."

In addition, \textit{TGF-$\beta$} can stimulate \textit{Shh} transcription (presumably via \textit{SMAD2/3/4}) \cite{chungCrosstalkShhTGFv2013}.

NodeDescription: {\color{NavyBlue} \textit{RhoA} is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases; it promotes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. It's primarily role in mesenhymal of crawling cell migration is to promote actin stress fibers formation and actomyosin contractility at the rear of a horizontally polarized cell, where it aids detachment \cite{schaksActinDynamicsCell2019}. As our model focuses exlusively on  mesenchymal migration, the active state of the \textit{RhoA} node corresponds to its activity at the rear of the cell, and thus contributes to horizontal polarity. Thus, \textit{RhoA} overexpression cannot be adequarly modeled by simply locking \textit{RhoA} ON; changing its relationship to the \textit{Horizontal\_Pol} node would also be required. At the back of the cell, \textit{RhoA} is activated by mitogen-drive \textit{AKT} signaling \cite{tripathiReceptorTyrosineKinase2017} or the absence of its inhibitor \textit{Rassf1a} \cite{leeRASSF1ADirectlyAntagonizes2016}.

To take into account theincrease in translation initiated by \textit{eIF4E} and loss of degradation-promoting phosphorylation when  \textit{GSK3$\beta$} is off \cite{searsMultipleRasdependentPhosphorylation2000}, we assumed that they can compensate for the lack of \textit{ERK}, absence of \textit{YAP}, {or interference from \textit{SMADs}}. Alternatively, increased transcription by  \textit{E2F1} can also promote  \textit{Myc} accumulation in the absence of active  \textit{pRB} \cite{roussel1994dual}, provided that the protein is stabilized by  \textit{ERK},  \textit{eIF4E}, or the absence of  \textit{GSK3$\beta$}.

Bound into a licensed pre-replication complex (\textit{Pre-RC}), \textit{Cdt1} remains stable as long as it is transcribed by \textit{E2F1} \cite{yoshidaRegulationGemininCdt12004} or \textit{Myc} \cite{valovkaTranscriptionalControlDNA2013} (this guarantees that \textit{Pre-RC} complexes cannot persist indefinitely in the absence of de novo transcription). Alternatively, it can be turned on by \textit{E2F1}, aided by \textit{Myc} or the absence of \textit{RB}, and \textit{FoxO3} in cells with 4N DNA.

NodeDescription: \textit{Cyclin A} activity requires transcription (\textit{Cyclin A} mRNA) and the absence of degradation by phosphorylated (mitotic) \textit{pAPC}. In addition, turning ON inactive \textit{Cyclin A} requires activation of \textit{Cdk2} by \textit{Cdc25A} \cite{blombergEctopicExpressionCdc25A1999} and the absence / \textit{Emi1}-mediated inhibition of \textit{APC/C\textsuperscript{Cdh1}}. Once active, \textit{Cyclin A} maintains its activity in the absence of overpowering influences driving its degradation. Namely, \textit{Cyclin A} relies on either \textit{Emi1} or the absence of \textit{UbcH10} for its ability to keep inactive \textit{APC/C\textsuperscript{Cdh1}} in check. To overpower active \textit{APC/C\textsuperscript{Cdh1}}, \textit{Cyclin A} requires both \textit{Emi1} and no \textit{UbcH10}. The precise combinatorial regulation of \textit{Cyclin A} is not known; the above logic is consistent with \textit{Cyclin A} activity pattern during cell cycle progression.
NodeNotes: gene id's are for cyclin A1. Old: S-phase activation of \textit{Cyclin A} requires transcription by \textit{E2F} factors AND \textit{Cdk2} activation by \textit{Cdc25A}  \cite{helinRegulationCellProliferation1998,blombergEctopicExpressionCdc25A1999, Katsuno:2009di}. When already active, \textit{Cyclin A} sustains its function in the absence of \textit{APC/C}-mediated degradation. \textit{Cyclin A} is degraded by \textit{APC/C}$^{Cdc20}$ (represented in the model as [\textit{pAPC} AND \textit{Cdc20}]), or  \textit{APC/C}$^{Cdh1}$ (represented by \textit{Cdh1}) in the presence of the \textit{UbcH10} protein \cite{Harper:2002ke,Rape:2004em,faureDynamicalAnalysisGeneric2006}.

  abstract = {It has long been postulated, although never directly demonstrated, that mitochondria are strategically positioned in the cytoplasm to meet local requirements for energy production. Here we show that positioning of mitochondria in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) determines the shape of intracellular energy gradients in living cells. Specifically, the ratio of ATP to ADP was highest at perinuclear areas of dense mitochondria and gradually decreased as more-peripheral sites were approached. Furthermore, the majority of mitochondria were positioned at the ventral surface of the cell, correlating with high ATP:ADP ratios close to the ventral membrane, which rapidly decreased toward the dorsal surface. We used cells deficient for the mitochondrial Rho-GTPase 1 (Miro1), an essential mediator of microtubule-based mitochondrial motility, to study how changes in mitochondrial positioning affect cytoplasmic energy distribution and cell migration, an energy-expensive process. The mitochondrial network in~Miro1-/-~MEFs was restricted to the perinuclear area, with few mitochondria present at the cell periphery. This change in mitochondrial distribution dramatically~reduced the ratio of ATP to ADP at the cell cortex and disrupted events essential for cell movement, including~actin dynamics, lamellipodia protrusion, and membrane ruffling. Cell adhesion status was also affected by changes in mitochondrial positioning; focal adhesion assembly and stability was decreased in Miro1-/- MEFs compared with~Miro1+/+ ~MEFs.~Consequently~Miro1-/-~MEFs migrated slower than control cells during both collective and single-cell migration. These data establish that Miro1-mediated mitochondrial positioning at the leading edge provides localized energy production that~promotes cell migration by supporting membrane protrusion and focal adhesion stability.},

Emi1, a major modulator of APC activity, is thought to act competitively as a pseudosubstrate. We show that the modulation of APC activity is more subtle: Emi1 inhibits ubiquitylation at both substrate binding and separately at the step of ubiquitin transfer to APC-bound substrates. The zinc-binding region of Emi1 allows multiple monoubiquitylation of substrates, but preferentially suppresses the ubiquitin chain elongation by UBCH10. Furthermore, the carboxy-terminal tail of Emi1 antagonizes chain elongation by Ube2S, by competitively preventing its binding to the APC cullin subunit through electrostatic interaction. Combinatorially, Emi1 effectively stabilizes APC substrates by suppressing ubiquitin chain extension. Deubiquitylating enzymes can then convert inhibited substrates to their basal state. Chain elongation may be a particularly sensitive step for controlling degradation, and this study provides the first kinetic evidence for how it is inhibited.},

  abstract = {A subset of eukaryotic transcription factors possesses the remarkable ability to reprogram one type of cell into another. The transcription factors that reprogram cell fate are invariably those that are crucial for the initial cell programming in embryonic development. To elicit cell programming or reprogramming, transcription factors must be able to engage genes that are developmentally silenced and inappropriate for expression in the original cell. Developmentally silenced genes are typically embedded in ``closed'' chromatin that is covered by nucleosomes and not hypersensitive to nuclease probes such as DNase I. Biochemical and genomic studies have shown that transcription factors with the highest reprogramming activity often have the special ability to engage their target sites on nucleosomal DNA, thus behaving as ``pioneer factors'' to initiate events in closed chromatin. Other reprogramming factors appear dependent on pioneer factors for engaging nucleosomes and closed chromatin. However, certain genomic domains in which nucleosomes are occluded by higher-order chromatin structures, such as in heterochromatin, are resistant to pioneer factor binding. Understanding the means by which pioneer factors can engage closed chromatin and how heterochromatin can prevent such binding promises to advance our ability to reprogram cell fates at will and is the topic of this review.},

To understand the functional role of the E2Fs in cell proliferation, we have developed cell lines expressing E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 fused to the estrogen receptor ligand binding domain (ER). In this study, we demonstrated that activation of all three E2Fs could relieve the mitogen requirement for entry into S phase in Rat1 fibroblasts and that E2F activity leads to a shortening of the G(0)-G(1) phase of the cell cycle by 6 to 7 h. In contrast to the current assumption that E2F-1 is the only E2F capable of inducing apoptosis, we showed that deregulated E2F-2 and E2F-3 activities also result in apoptosis. Using the ERE2F-expressing cell lines, we demonstrated that several genes containing E2F DNA binding sites are efficiently induced by the E2Fs in the absence of protein synthesis. Furthermore, CDC25A is defined as a novel E2F target whose expression can be directly regulated by E2F-1. Data showing that CDC25A is an essential target for E2F-1, since its activity is required for efficient induction of S phase by E2F-1, are provided. Finally, our results show that expression of two E2F target genes, namely CDC25A and cyclin E, is sufficient to induce entry into S phase in quiescent fibroblasts. Taken together, our results provide an important step in defining how E2F activity leads to deregulated proliferation.},

A population might enhance its fitness by allowing individual cells to stochastically transition among multiple phenotypes, thus ensuring that some cells are always prepared for an unforeseen environmental fluctuation. Here we experimentally explore how switching affects population growth by using the galactose utilization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a strain that randomly transitions between two phenotypes as a result of stochastic gene expression. Each phenotype was designed to confer a growth advantage over the other phenotype in a certain environment. When we compared the growth of two populations with different switching rates, we found that fast-switching populations outgrow slow switchers when the environment fluctuates rapidly, whereas slow-switching phenotypes outgrow fast switchers when the environment changes rarely. These results suggest that cells may tune inter-phenotype switching rates to the frequency of environmental changes.},

In a search for Lef-1 responsive genes in human osteoblasts, we focused on the transcriptional regulation of the SLUG, a zinc finger transcription factor belonging to the Snail family of developmental proteins. Although the role of SLUG in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell motility during embryogenesis is well documented, the functions of this factor in most normal adult human tissues are largely unknown. In this study we investigated SLUG expression in normal human osteoblasts and their mesenchymal precursors, and its possible correlation with Lef-1 and Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signalling.                                         Results                                The experiments were performed on normal human primary osteoblasts obtained from bone fragments, cultured in osteogenic conditions in presence of Lef-1 expression vector or GSK-3{$\beta$} inhibitor, SB216763. We demonstrated that the transcription factor SLUG is present in osteoblasts as well as in their mesenchymal precursors obtained from Wharton's Jelly of human umbilical cord and induced to osteoblastic differentiation. We found that SLUG is positively correlated with RUNX2 expression and deposition of mineralized matrix, and is regulated by Lef-1 and {$\beta$}-catenin. Consistently, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, used to detect the direct Lef/Tcf factors that are responsible for the promoter activity of SLUG gene, demonstrated that Lef-1, TCF-1 and TCF4 are recruited to the SLUG gene promoter "                 in vivo                 ".                                                        Conclusion               These studies provide, for the first time, the evidence that SLUG expression is correlated with osteogenic commitment, and is positively regulated by Lef-1 signal in normal human osteoblasts. These findings will help to further understand the regulation of the human SLUG gene and reveal the biological functions of SLUG in the context of bone tissue.},

Bcl-2 protein family regulates pathways to apoptosis that are activated upon growth factor deprivation. Pro-apoptotic proteins that have only a single Bcl-2 homology domain, BH3-only, are potent inducers of apoptosis. In myeloma cells, Mcl-1 has been shown to be a major anti-apoptotic protein that appears to regulate cell survival through the JAK/STAT pathway. In this study, we examined the regulation of the BH3-only protein Bim and its interaction with Mcl-1. The three major Bim isoforms are expressed in myeloma cells and are negatively regulated by IL-6. Blockade of IL-6 signaling induces an up-regulation of Bim concomitant to Mcl-1 down-regulation. Of major interest, Bim is found strongly associated with Mcl-1 in viable myeloma cells while this interaction is disrupted under apoptosis induction. Of note, while Bim is also found strongly associated to Bcl-2, this interaction is not changed under apoptosis induction. Thus, in myeloma cells, Mcl-1 neutralizes Bim through complex formation and therefore prevents apoptosis. Under apoptosis induction, the disappearance of Mcl-1 allows Bim to exercise its pro-apoptotic function and to activate Bax.},

  abstract = {Mesenteric lymph nodes of the rat were studied by scanning electron microscopy after arterial perfusion fixation. Observation was made mainly of the high endothelial venules (HEVs), inner cortex and medulla. The HEVs were distributed not only in the inner cortex, but also in the interfollicular areas in the outer cortex, extending to closely beneath the marginal sinus. Various surface structures of the HEV endothelial cells were recorded, from quite smooth to densely granular. Special attention was paid to endothelial cells with cytoplasmic ridges concentrated at the center of the cell apex. Lymphocytes were numerously attached to the luminal surface of the HEV. Many lymphocytes presumably under and after emigration through the HEV wall could be recognized. Hitherto unknown labyrinths densely filled with lymphocytes were demonstrated in the inner cortex. These tubular and saccular spaces lined by attenuated cells originated from beneath the germinal centers and from around the HEVs to pour into the medullary sinuses. The lymphatic labyrinths were differentiated from the sinuses by their lack of reticular cell trabeculae and by their containing almost exclusively small lymphocytes. It was proposed that lymphocytes in the blood in HEVs massively emigrate to the labyrinth, and via the medullary sinuses, enter the efferent lymphatics of the lymph node. In the medullary sinuses, some lymphocytes in association with a macrophage were found to extend wing-like processes, probably reflecting their activation. Large free cells extending laminar projections, but smooth in surface otherwise, were occasionally found. Their possible identity with the veiled cells (KELLY et al., 1978) was considered.},

Recently, the PAK1 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in cancer due to its role in many oncogenic signaling pathways. Many PAK1 inhibitors have been developed as potential preclinical agents for cancer therapy. Here, we provide an overview of essential roles that PAK1 plays in cancer, including its structure and autoactivation mechanism, its crucial function from onset to progression to metastasis, metabolism, immune escape and even drug resistance in cancer; endogenous regulators; and cancer-related pathways. We also summarize the reported PAK1 small-molecule inhibitors based on their structure types and their potential application in cancer. In addition, we provide overviews on current progress and future challenges of PAK1 in cancer, hoping to provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.},

  abstract = {AUF1 is an AU-rich element (ARE)-binding protein that recruits translation initiation factors, molecular chaperones, and mRNA degradation enzymes to the ARE for mRNA destruction. We recently found chaperone Hsp27 to be an AUF1-associated ARE-binding protein required for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}) mRNA degradation in monocytes. Hsp27 is a multifunctional protein that participates in ubiquitination of proteins for their degradation by proteasomes. A variety of extracellular stimuli promote Hsp27 phosphorylation on three serine residues--Ser(15), Ser(78), and Ser(82)-by a number of kinases, including the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) pathway kinases p38 and MK2. Activating either kinase stabilizes ARE mRNAs. Likewise, ectopic expression of phosphomimetic mutant forms of Hsp27 stabilizes reporter ARE mRNAs. Here, we continued to examine the contributions of Hsp27 to mRNA degradation. As AUF1 is ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes, we addressed the hypothesis that Hsp27 phosphorylation controls AUF1 levels to modulate ARE mRNA degradation. Indeed, selected phosphomimetic mutants of Hsp27 promote proteolysis of AUF1 in a proteasome-dependent fashion and render ARE mRNAs more stable. Our results suggest that the p38 MAP kinase (MAPK)-MK2-Hsp27 signaling axis may target AUF1 destruction by proteasomes, thereby promoting ARE mRNA stabilization.},

However, it remains unclear whether E-cadherin and nectins up-regulate, maintain or suppress Rac1 activity during cell-cell adhesion. Roles for Rho GTPases are complicated by cell spreading and integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix that occur concurrently with cell-cell adhesion, and which also require Rho GTPases. Here, we designed a simple approach to examine Rac1 activity upon cell-cell adhesion by MDCK epithelial cells, without cell spreading or integrin-based adhesion. Upon initiation of cell-cell contact in 3-D cell aggregates, we observed an initial peak of Rac1 activity that rapidly decreased by {$\sim$}66\% within 5 minutes, and further decreased to a low baseline level after 30 minutes. Inhibition of E-cadherin engagement with DECMA-1 Fab fragments or competitive binding of soluble E-cadherin, or nectin2alpha extracellular domain completely inhibited Rac1 activity. These results indicate that cadherins and nectins cooperate to induce and then rapidly suppress Rac1 activity during initial cell-cell adhesion, which may be important in inhibiting the migratory cell phenotype and allowing the establishment of initially weak cell-cell adhesions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Aberrant blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is a hallmark pathology of many central nervous system diseases. von Willebrand factor (VWF) is stored in endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies from where it is released on activation into plasma and basement membrane. The role of VWF in endothelial homeostasis is unclear. The goal of this study was to assess the role of VWF in disease models associated with increased BBB permeability. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We did not find any differences in BBB permeability to Evans blue dye at baseline between wild-type and VWF(-/-) animals. We next used 2 models presenting with increased BBB permeability, hypoxia/reoxygenation and pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, to assess the response of VWF(-/-) animals. In both models, VWF(-/-) mice maintained a tighter BBB than wild-type mice. VWF(-/-) mice fared worse in both conditions, with {$\approx$} 100\% of VWF(-/-) mice dying within 120 minutes after pilocarpine administration, whereas {$>$}80\% of wild-type animals survived. Investigation into the status of tight junction proteins revealed that VWF(-/-) mice expressed more claudin-5 at baseline. In vitro work confirmed that the presence of subendothelial VWF is inhibitory to claudin-5 expression. CONCLUSIONS: VWF deficiency confers partial preservation of BBB integrity after hypoxia/reoxygenation and seizures. Surprisingly, this decrease in BBB permeability did not result in protection of animals because they demonstrated more severe pathology in both models compared with wild-type animals. These data suggest that a rigid BBB is detrimental (to the organism) during certain disease states and that VWF release may provide desired flexibility under stress.},

The pro-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues BAX and BAK are activated following the induction of apoptosis and induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria. A second class of BCL-2 homologues, the BH3-only proteins, is required for the activation of BAX and BAK. The activity of both BAX/BAK and BH3-only proteins is opposed by anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues such as BCL-2 and MCL-1. Here we show that anti-apoptotic MCL-1 inhibits the function of BAX downstream of its initial activation and translocation to mitochondria. Although MCL-1 interacted with BAK and inhibited its activation, the activity of MCL-1 against BAX was independent of an interaction between the two proteins. However, the anti-apoptotic function of MCL-1 required the presence of BAX. These results suggest that the pro-survival activity of MCL-1 proceeds via inhibition of BAX function at mitochondria, downstream of its activation and translocation to this organelle.},

The goal of the present study was to confirm the functional relevance of the -119 GABP-binding site in vivo. To that end, the Hprt locus of mice was targeted with a Robo4-LacZ transgenic cassette in which the GABP site was mutated. In other studies, the GABP mutation was introduced into the endogenous mouse Robo4 locus in which LacZ was knocked-in. Compared with their respective controls, the mutant promoters displayed a significant reduction in activity in embryoid bodies, embryos, and adult animals.

Deregulation of c-myc leads to tumorigenesis, and c-myc is an important driver in human cancer. Myc and its dimerization partner Max are bHLH-Zip DNA binding proteins involved in transcriptional regulation of target genes. Non-transcriptional functions have also been attributed to the Myc protein, notably direct interaction with the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) controlling the initiation of DNA replication. A key component of the pre-RC is the Cdt1 protein, an essential factor in origin licensing. Here we present data suggesting that the CDT1 gene is a transcriptional target of the Myc-Max complex. Expression of the CDT1 gene in v-myc-transformed cells directly correlates with myc expression. Also, human tumor cells with elevated c-myc expression display increased CDT1 expression. Occupation of the CDT1 promoter by Myc-Max is demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and transactivation by Myc-Max is shown in reporter assays. Ectopic expression of CDT1 leads to cell transformation. Our results provide a possible direct mechanistic link of Myc's canonical function as a transcription factor to DNA replication. Furthermore, we suggest that aberrant transcriptional activation of CDT1 by deregulated myc alleles contributes to the genomic instabilities observed in tumor cells.},

These mechanical inputs, which may be encoded in the form of extracellular matrix stiffness, dimensionality, and adhesion, all strongly influence cell morphology, migration, and fate decisions. One mechanism through which cells on planar or pseudo-planar matrices exert tensile forces and interrogate microenvironmental mechanics is through stress fibers, which are bundles composed of actin filaments and, in most cases, non-muscle myosin II filaments. Stress fibers form a continuous structural network that is mechanically coupled to the extracellular matrix through focal adhesions. Furthermore, myosin-driven contractility plays a central role in the ability of stress fibers to sense matrix mechanics and generate tension. Here, we review the distinct roles that non-muscle myosin II plays in driving mechanosensing and focus specifically on motility. In a closely related discussion, we also describe stress fiber classification schemes and the differing roles of various myosin isoforms in each category. Finally, we briefly highlight recent studies exploring mechanosensing in three-dimensional environments, in which matrix content, structure, and mechanics are often tightly interrelated. Stress fibers and the myosin motors therein represent an intriguing and functionally important biological system in which mechanics, biochemistry, and architecture all converge.},

The protein kinase mTOR is the catalytic subunit of two distinct signaling complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2, that link energy and nutrients to the regulation of cellular growth and energy metabolism. Activation of mTOR in response to nutrients and growth factors results in the phosphorylation of numerous substrates, including the phosphorylations of S6 kinase by mTORC1 and Akt by mTORC2. Alterations in Akt and mTOR activity have been linked to the progression of multiple diseases such as cancer and type 2 diabetes. Although PRAS40 was first reported as substrate for Akt, investigations toward mTOR-binding partners subsequently identified PRAS40 as both component and substrate of mTORC1. Phosphorylation of PRAS40 by Akt and by mTORC1 itself results in dissociation of PRAS40 from mTORC1 and may relieve an inhibitory constraint on mTORC1 activity. Adding to the complexity is that gene silencing studies indicate that PRAS40 is also necessary for the activity of the mTORC1 complex. This review summarizes the regulation and potential function(s) of PRAS40 in the complex Akt- and mTOR-signaling network in health and disease.},

Recently, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) has been found activated in TSC lesions lacking TSC1 or TSC2 LOH. Here, we show that Erk may play a critical role in TSC progression through posttranslational inactivation of TSC2. Erk-dependent phosphorylation leads to TSC1-TSC2 dissociation and markedly impairs TSC2 ability to inhibit mTOR signaling, cell proliferation, and oncogenic transformation. Importantly, expression of an Erk nonphosphorylatable TSC2 mutant in TSC2+/- tumor cells where Erk is constitutively activated blocks tumorigenecity in vivo, while wild-type TSC2 is ineffective. Our findings position the Ras/MAPK pathway upstream of the TSC complex and suggest that Erk may modulate mTOR signaling and contribute to disease progression through phosphorylation and inactivation of TSC2.},

Consistent with a role as a tumor suppressor, Sprouty2 expression is often down-regulated in human cancers. However, Sprouty2 is up-regulated in some cancers, suggesting the existence of posttranscriptional mechanisms that permit evasion of Sprouty2-mediated antitumorigenic properties. We report that MAPK activation induces Sprouty2 phosphorylation on six serine residues, which reduced Sprouty2 association with wild-type B-Raf. Mutation of these six serines to nonphosphorylatable alanines increased the ability of Sprouty2 to inhibit growth factor-induced MAPK activation. Oncogenic B-Raf mutants such as B-Raf V600E did not associate with Sprouty2, but this resistance to Sprouty2 binding was not due to phosphorylation. Instead, the active kinase conformation induced by oncogenic mutation prevents Sprouty2 binding. These results reveal a dual mechanism that affects the Sprouty2/B-Raf interaction: Sprouty phosphorylation and B-Raf conformation.},

  abstract = {To extend the mammalian cell death pathway, we screened for further Bcl-2 interacting proteins. Both yeast two-hybrid screening and lambda expression cloning identified a novel interacting protein, Bad, whose homology to Bcl-2 is limited to the BH1 and BH2 domains. Bad selectively dimerized with Bcl-xL as well as Bcl-2, but not with Bax, Bcl-xs, Mcl-1, A1, or itself. Bad binds more strongly to Bcl-xL than Bcl-2 in mammalian cells, and it reversed the death repressor activity of Bcl-xL, but not that of Bcl-2. When Bad dimerized with Bcl-xL, Bax was displaced and apoptosis was restored. When approximately half of Bax was heterodimerized, death was inhibited. The susceptibility of a cell to a death signal is determined by these competing dimerizations in which levels of Bad influence the effectiveness of Bcl-2 versus Bcl-xL in repressing death.},

Conversely, protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates two subunits of APC but suppresses APC activity.

In animal cells, cyclin A is always degraded before cyclin B, but the exact timing and the mechanism underlying this are not known. Here we use live cell imaging to show that cyclin A begins to be degraded just after nuclear envelope breakdown. This degradation requires the 26S proteasome, but is not affected by the spindle checkpoint. Neither deletion of its destruction box nor disrupting Cdk binding prevents cyclin A proteolysis, but Cdk binding is necessary for degradation at the correct time. We also show that increasing the levels of cyclin A delays chromosome alignment and sister chromatid segregation. This delay depends on the proteolysis of cyclin A and is not caused by a lag in the bipolar attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, nor is it mediated via the spindle checkpoint. Thus, proteolysis that is not under the control of the spindle checkpoint is required for chromosome alignment and anaphase.},

This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the `relative stabilities' of N attractors (N {$>$} 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin\textendash Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.},

  abstract = {{$\alpha$}-catenin is a key protein of adherens junctions (AJs) with mechanosensory properties. It also acts as a tumor suppressor that limits tissue growth. Here we analyzed the function of Drosophila {$\alpha$}-Catenin ({$\alpha$}-Cat) in growth regulation of the wing epithelium. We found that different {$\alpha$}-Cat levels led to a differential activation of Hippo/Yorkie or JNK signaling causing tissue overgrowth or degeneration, respectively. {$\alpha$}-Cat can modulate Yorkie-dependent tissue growth through recruitment of Ajuba, a negative regulator of Hippo signaling to AJs but also through a mechanism independent of Ajuba recruitment to AJs. Both mechanosensory regions of {$\alpha$}-Cat, the M region and the actin-binding domain (ABD), contribute to growth regulation. Whereas M is dispensable for {$\alpha$}-Cat function in the wing, individual M domains (M1, M2, M3) have opposing effects on growth regulation. In particular, M1 limits Ajuba recruitment. Loss of M1 causes Ajuba hyper-recruitment to AJs, promoting tissue-tension independent overgrowth. Although M1 binds Vinculin, Vinculin is not responsible for this effect. Moreover, disruption of mechanosensing of the {$\alpha$}-Cat ABD affects tissue growth, with enhanced actin interactions stabilizing junctions and leading to tissue overgrowth. Together, our findings indicate that {$\alpha$}-Cat acts through multiple mechanisms to control tissue growth, including regulation of AJ stability, mechanosensitive Ajuba recruitment, and dynamic direct F-actin interactions.},

The hallmark of proliferating populations is progression through the cell cycle, which is driven by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Here, we introduce a live-cell sensor for CDK2 activity and unexpectedly found that proliferating cells bifurcate into two populations as they exit mitosis. Many cells immediately commit to the next cell cycle by building up CDK2 activity from an intermediate level, while other cells lack CDK2 activity and enter a transient state of quiescence. This bifurcation is directly controlled by the CDK inhibitor p21 and is regulated by mitogens during a restriction window at the end~of the previous cell cycle. Thus, cells decide at the end of mitosis to either start the next cell cycle by immediately building up CDK2 activity or to enter a transient G0-like state by suppressing CDK2 activity.},

The activation of Bid by caspase-8 in this pathway promotes further cytochrome c release, thereby completing a positive feedback loop of caspase activation. Although the identity of the caspases necessary for caspase-8 activation in this pathway are known, it is still unclear which protease directly cleaves caspase-8. In order to identify the factor responsible we undertook a biochemical purification of caspase-8 cleaving activity in cytosolic extracts to which cytochrome c had been added. Here we report that caspase-6 is the only soluble protease in cytochrome c activated Jurkat cell extracts that has significant caspase-8 cleaving activity. Furthermore the caspase-6 that we purified was sufficient to induce Bid dependent cytochrome c releasing activity in cell extracts. Inhibition of caspase-6 activity in cells significantly inhibited caspase-8 cleavage and apoptosis, therefore establishing caspase-6 as a major activator of caspase-8 in vivo and confirming that this pathway can have a critical role in promotion of apoptosis. We also show that caspase-6 is inactive until the short prodomain is removed. We suggest that the requirement for two distinct cleavage steps to activate an effector caspase may represent an effective mechanism for restriction of spontaneous caspase activation and aberrant entry into apoptosis.},

Time-lapse microscopy measurements showed that SynEx cells generated competence dynamics similar to native cells and reconstituted the physiology of differentiation. However, architectural differences between the circuits altered the dynamic distribution of stochastic fluctuations (noise) during circuit operation. This distinction in noise causes functional differences between the circuits by selectively controlling the timing of competence episodes and response of the system to various DNA concentrations. These results reveal a tradeoff between temporal precision and physiological response range that is controlled by distinct noise characteristics of alternative circuit architectures.},

Endothelial cells undergo profound shape change and reorientation in response to physiological levels of fluid shear stress. These morphological changes influence cell function; however, the processes that produce them are poorly understood. We have examined how actin assembly is related to shear-induced endothelial cell shape change. To do so, we imposed physiological levels of shear stress on cultured endothelium for up to 96 hours and then permeabilized the cells and exposed them briefly to fluorescently labeled monomeric actin at various time points to assess actin assembly. Alternatively, monomeric actin was microinjected into cells to allow continuous monitoring of actin distribution. Actin assembly occurred primarily at the ends of stress fibers, which simultaneously reoriented to the shear axis, frequently fused with neighboring stress fibers, and ultimately drove the poles of the cells in the upstream and/or downstream directions. Actin polymerization occurred where stress fibers inserted into focal adhesion complexes, but usually only at one end of the stress fiber. Neither the upstream nor downstream focal adhesion complex was preferred. Changes in actin organization were accompanied by translocation and remodeling of cell-substrate adhesion complexes and transient formation of punctate cell-cell adherens junctions. These findings indicate that stress fiber assembly and realignment provide a novel mode by which cell morphology is altered by mechanical signals.},

Here, we report the regulation of Mcl-1 destabilization and cathepsin D-regulated caspase-8 activation by GSK-3{$\beta$} and caspase-2. Treatment with either the ceramide analogue C2-ceramide or the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide sequentially induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), the reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and apoptosis. Following LMP, cathepsin D translocated from lysosomes to the cytoplasm, whereas inhibiting cathepsin D blocked mitochondrial apoptosis. Furthermore, cathepsin D caused the activation of caspase-8 but not caspase-2. Inhibiting GSK-3{$\beta$} and caspase-2 blocked Mcl-1 destabilization, LMP, cathepsin D re-localization, caspase-8 activation, and mitochondrial apoptosis. Expression of Mcl-1 was localized to the lysosomes, and forced expression of Mcl-1 prevented apoptotic signaling via the lysosomal-mitochondrial pathway. These results demonstrate the importance of GSK-3{$\beta$} and caspase-2 in ceramide- and etoposide-induced apoptosis through mechanisms involving Mcl-1 destabilization and the lysosomal-mitochondrial axis.},

In this paper, we provide evidence that IL-2-mediated induction of the c-myb gene occurs via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, that protein kinase B (PKB) is the principal transducer of this signal, and that activation of the c-myb promoter can be abolished by deletion of conserved E2F and NF-kappaB binding sites. We show that Myb is required to protect activated peripheral T cells from bcl-2-independent apoptosis and that overexpression of oncogenic v-Myb is antiapoptotic. Overexpression of a Myb dominant-negative transgene abrogates PKB-mediated protection from apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that induction of c-myb transcription is an important downstream event for PKB-mediated protection of T cells from programmed cell death.},

  abstract = {The formation of a hierarchical vascular network, composed of arteries, veins, and capillaries, is essential for embryogenesis and is required for the production of new functional vasculature in the adult. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate the differentiation of vascular endothelial cells into arterial and venous cell fates is requisite for regenerative medicine, as the directed formation of perfused vessels is desirable in a myriad of pathological settings, such as in diabetes and following myocardial infarction. Additionally, this knowledge will enhance our understanding and treatment of vascular anomalies, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). From studies in vertebrate model organisms, such as mouse, zebrafish, and chick, a number of key signaling pathways have been elucidated that are required for the establishment and maintenance of arterial and venous fates. These include the Hedgehog, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Transforming Growth Factor-{$\beta$} (TGF-{$\beta$}), Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways. In addition, a variety of transcription factor families acting downstream of, or in concert with, these signaling networks play vital roles in arteriovenous (AV) specification. These include Notch and Notch-regulated transcription factors (e.g., HEY and HES), SOX factors, Forkhead factors, {$\beta$}-Catenin, ETS factors, and COUP-TFII. It is becoming apparent that AV specification is a highly coordinated process that involves the intersection and carefully orchestrated activity of multiple signaling cascades and transcriptional networks. This review will summarize the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the acquisition and maintenance of AV fate, and will highlight some of the limitations in our current knowledge of the molecular machinery that directs AV morphogenesis.

Precise conditions under which these diversification strategies confer an advantage have not been well defined. We develop a model of population growth conditioned on dynamical environmental and cellular states. Transitions among cellular states, in turn, may be biased by possibly noisy readings of the environment from cellular sensors. For various types of environmental dynamics and cellular sensor capability, we apply game-theoretic analysis to derive the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for an organism and determine when that strategy is diversification. We find that: (1) RPV, effecting a sort of Parrondo paradox wherein random alternations between losing strategies produce a winning strategy, is selected when transitions between different selective environments cannot be sensed, (2) optimal RPV cell switching rates are a function of environmental lifecycle asymmetries and environmental autocorrelation, (3) probabilistic diversification upon entering a new environment is selected when sensors can detect environmental transitions but have poor precision in identifying new environments, and (4) in the presence of excess additive noise, low-pass filtering is required for evolutionary stability. We show that even when RPV is not the ESS, it may minimize growth rate variance and the risk of extinction due to 'unlucky' environmental dynamics.},

RhoA and Rac1 have to be respectively activated and inactivated at the division plane for cytokinesis to occur properly. The inactivation of Rac1 at the cleavage furrow is controlled by MgcRacGAP. However, the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Rac1 during cell division remains unknown. Here, using a siRNA screening approach in HeLa cells, we identify Trio as a mitotic GEF of Rac1. We demonstrate that Trio controls Rac1 activation and subsequent F-actin remodeling in dividing cells. Moreover, Trio depletion specifically rescues the cytokinesis failure induced by MgcRacGAP depletion. Of importance, we demonstrate that this rescue is mediated by the Trio-Rac1 pathway, using GEF-dead mutants of Trio and a specific inhibitor of Rac1 activation by Trio. Overall this work identifies for the first time a GEF controlling Rac1 activation in dividing cells that counteracts MgcRacGAP function in cytokinesis.},

Although mitochondria in interphase HeLa cells are long tubular network structures, they are fragmented in early mitotic phase, and the filamentous network structures are subsequently reformed in the daughter cells. In marked contrast, tubular mitochondrial structures are maintained during mitosis in Drp1 knockdown cells, indicating that the mitochondrial fragmentation in mitosis requires mitochondrial fission by Drp1. Drp1 was specifically phosphorylated in mitosis by Cdk1/cyclin B on Ser-585. Exogenous expression of unphosphorylated mutant Drp1S585A led to reduced mitotic mitochondrial fragmentation.

We experimentally confirmed this prediction in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro. In agreement with the mathematical model, this indicates that changes in proliferative mode caused by small changes in concentrations of growth factors are not easily reversible.

Commitment to death via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway requires activation of the mitochondrial pore-forming proteins BAK or BAX. Activation can be effected by the activator BH3-only proteins BID or BIM, which have been considered to be functionally redundant in this role. Herein, we show that significant activation preferences exist between these proteins: BID preferentially activates BAK while BIM preferentially activates BAX. Furthermore, we find that cells lacking BAK are relatively resistant to agents that require BID activation for maximal induction of apoptosis, including topoisomerase inhibitors and TRAIL. Consequently, patients with tumors that harbor a loss of BAK1 exhibit an inferior response to topoisomerase inhibitor treatment in the clinic. Therefore, BID and BIM have nonoverlapping roles in the induction of apoptosis via BAK and BAX, affecting chemotherapy response.},

Expression of Foxm1 is found in a variety of distinct human cancers including hepatocellular carcinomas, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, ductal breast carcinomas, and anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas. In this study, we show that human Foxm1 protein is abundantly expressed in highly proliferative human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) as well as in mouse lung tumors induced by urethane. To determine the role of Foxm1 during the development of mouse lung tumors, we used IFN-inducible Mx-Cre recombinase transgene to delete mouse Foxm1 fl/fl-targeted allele before inducing lung tumors with urethane. We show that Mx-Cre Foxm1-/- mice exhibit diminished proliferation of lung tumor cells causing a significant reduction in number and size of lung adenomas. Transient transfection experiments with A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells show that depletion of Foxm1 levels by short interfering RNA caused diminished DNA replication and mitosis and reduced anchorage-independent growth of cell colonies on soft agar. Foxm1-depleted A549 cells exhibit reduced expression of cell cycle-promoting cyclin A2 and cyclin B1 genes.

To understand how signaling networks process dynamic inputs into gene expression outputs and the role of noise in cellular information processing, we studied the immune pathway NF-{$\kappa$}B under periodic cytokine inputs using microfluidic single-cell measurements and stochastic modeling. We find that NF-{$\kappa$}B dynamics in fibroblasts synchronize with oscillating TNF signal and become entrained, leading to significantly increased NF-{$\kappa$}B oscillation amplitude and mRNA output compared to non-entrained response. Simulations show that intrinsic biochemical noise in individual cells improves NF-{$\kappa$}B oscillation and entrainment, whereas cell-to-cell variability in NF-{$\kappa$}B natural frequency creates population robustness, together enabling entrainment over a wider range of dynamic inputs. This wide range is confirmed by experiments where entrained cells were measured under all input periods. These results indicate that synergy between oscillation and noise allows cells to achieve efficient gene expression in dynamically changing signaling environments.},

The carboxy-terminal domain of FoxM1 binds Plk1, and phosphorylation of two key residues in this domain by Cdk1 is essential for Plk1-FoxM1 interaction. Formation of the Plk1-FoxM1 complex allows for direct phosphorylation of FoxM1 by Plk1 at G2/M and the subsequent activation of FoxM1 activity, which is required for expression of key mitotic regulators, including Plk1 itself. Thus, Plk1-dependent regulation of FoxM1 activity provides a positive-feedback loop ensuring tight regulation of transcriptional networks essential for orderly mitotic progression.},

The arrest-resistant phenotype was not due to loss of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors. TGF-beta was shown to regulate p15INK4B expression at at least two levels: mRNA accumulation and protein stability. In TGF-beta-arrested HMEC, there was not only an increase in p15 mRNA but also a major increase in p5INK4B protein stability. As cdk4- and cdk6-associated p15INK4B increased during TGF-beta arrest of sensitive cells, there was a loss of cyclin D1, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 from these kinase complexes, and cyclin E-cdk2-associated p27Kip1 increased. In HMEC, p15INK4B complexes did not contain detectable cyclin. p15INK4B from both sensitive and resistant cells could displace in vitro cyclin D1, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 from cdk4 isolated from sensitive cells. Cyclin D1 could not be displaced from cdk4 in the resistant 184A1L5R cell lysates. Thus, in TGF-beta arrest, p15INK4B may displace already associated cyclin D1 from cdks and prevent new cyclin D1-cdk complexes from forming. Furthermore, p27Kip1 binding shifts from cdk4 to cyclin E-cdk2 during TGF-beta-mediated arrest. The importance of posttranslational regulation of p15INK4B by TGF-beta is underlined by the observation that in TGF-beta-resistant 184A1L5R, although the p15 transcript increased, p15INK4B protein was not stabilized and did not accumulate, and cyclin D1-cdk association and kinase activation were not inhibited.},

  abstract = {Notch signalling is important for development and tissue homeostasis and activated in many human cancers. Nevertheless, mutations in Notch pathway components are rare in solid tumours. ZEB1 is an activator of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and has crucial roles in tumour progression towards metastasis. ZEB1 and miR-200 family members repress expression of each other in a reciprocal feedback loop. Since miR-200 members target stem cell factors, ZEB1 indirectly induces stemness maintenance and associated drug resistance. Here, we link ZEB1 and its cancer promoting properties to Notch activation. We show that miR-200 members target Notch pathway components, such as Jagged1 (Jag1) and the mastermind-like coactivators Maml2 and Maml3, thereby mediating enhanced Notch activation by ZEB1. We further detected a coordinated upregulation of Jag1 and ZEB1, associated with reduced miR-200 expression in two aggressive types of human cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and basal type of breast cancer. These findings explain increased Notch signalling in some types of cancers, where mutations in Notch pathway genes are rare. Moreover, they indicate an additional way how ZEB1 exerts its tumour progressing functions.},

Migrating cells have a polarized morphology with an asymmetric distribution of signalling molecules and the cytoskeleton. Linkage of microtubule plus ends to the cortical region is essential for polarized migration. +TIPs, including CLIP-170 and APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) are thought to function as capturing devices at specialized cortical regions. Rho family GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Cdc42, play pivotal roles in cell polarization and migration acting through their effectors. We found that IQGAP1, an effector of Rac1 and Cdc42, interacts with CLIP-170. Activated Rac1 and Cdc42 enhance the binding of IQGAP1 to CLIP-170, and capture GFP-CLIP-170 at the base of leading edges and filopodia, respectively. Recently, we found that IQGAP1 directly binds to APC in addition to CLIP-170. IQGAP1 and APC interdependently localize to leading edges in migrating cells. IQGAP1 can link APC to actin filaments in vitro. Thus, activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 in response to migration signals leads to recruitment of IQGAP1 and APC which, together with CLIP-170, form a complex that links the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule dynamics during cell polarization and migration.},

Rho-family GTPases, including Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA, play a central role in establishing cell polarisation, which requires asymmetric and ordered distribution of the signalling molecules and the cytoskeleton. Recent advances reveal that Rho GTPases, together with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, contribute to asymmetric phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate distribution via a positive-feedback loop. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate thereby activates the signalling cascades to the cytoskeleton as a second messenger. Rho GTPases also capture and stabilise microtubules through their effectors (e.g. IQGAP1, mDia and Par6) near the cell cortex, leading to polarised cell morphology and directional cell migration. Thus, elucidation of the signal transduction cascades from receptors to Rho GTPases and, subsequently, from Rho GTPases to microtubules has begun.},

A mathematical model of cell-cycle progression in cell-free egg extracts from frog predicts that irreversible transitions into and out of mitosis are driven by hysteresis in the molecular control system. Hysteresis refers to toggle-like switching behavior in a dynamical system. In the mathematical model, the toggle switch is created by positive feedback in the phosphorylation reactions controlling the activity of Cdc2, a protein kinase bound to its regulatory subunit, cyclin B. To determine whether hysteresis underlies entry into and exit from mitosis in cell-free egg extracts, we tested three predictions of the Novak-Tyson model. (i) The minimal concentration of cyclin B necessary to drive an interphase extract into mitosis is distinctly higher than the minimal concentration necessary to hold a mitotic extract in mitosis, evidence for hysteresis. (ii) Unreplicated DNA elevates the cyclin threshold for Cdc2 activation, indication that checkpoints operate by enlarging the hysteresis loop. (iii) A dramatic "slowing down" in the rate of Cdc2 activation is detected at concentrations of cyclin B marginally above the activation threshold. All three predictions were validated. These observations confirm hysteresis as the driving force for cell-cycle transitions into and out of mitosis.},

  abstract = {Tumors are composed of heterogeneous phenotypes, each having different sensitivities to the microenvironment. One microenvironment characteristic - matrix stiffness - helps to regulate malignant transformation and invasion in mammary tumors, but its influence on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is unclear. We observed that, on stiff matrices, a highly invasive OSCC cell line (SCC25) comprising a low E-cad to N-cad ratio (InvH/E:NL; SCC25) had increased migration velocity and decreased adhesion strength compared to a less invasive OSCC cell line (Cal27) with high E-cad to N-cad ratio (InvL/E:NH; Cal27). However, InvL/E:NH cells acquire a mesenchymal signature and begin to migrate faster when exposed to prolonged time on a stiff niche, suggesting that cells can be mechanically conditioned. Owing to increased focal adhesion assembly, InvL/E:NH cells migrated faster, which could be reduced when increasing integrin affinity with high divalent cation concentrations. Mirroring these data in human patients, we observed that collagen organization, an indicator of matrix stiffness, was increased with advanced disease and correlated with early recurrence. Consistent with epithelial tumors, our data suggest that OSCC cells are mechanically sensitive and that their contribution to tumor progression is mediated in part by this sensitivity.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.},

Phosphorylated FOXOs could not exhibit transcriptional activity because of their nuclear export. Here we show that p15(INK4b) and p19(INK4d) transcription is associated with FOXO-mediated G1 cell-cycle arrest. Inhibition of Akt signaling by PI3K inhibitors, a PDK1 inhibitor, or dominant-negative Akt transfection increased expression of p15(INK4b) and p19(INK4d) but not p16(INK4a) and p18(INK4c). Ectopic expression of wild type or active FOXO but not inactive form also increased p15(INK4b) and p19(INK4d) levels. FOXOs bound to promoter regions and induced transcription of these genes. No increase in the G1-arrested cell population, mediated by PI3K inhibitor LY294002, was observed in INK4b-/- or INK4d-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts. In summary, FOXOs are involved in G1 arrest caused by Akt inactivation via p15(INK4b) and p19(INK4d) transcription.},

YAP/TAZ activity is confined to cells exposed to mechanical stresses, such as stretching, location at edges/curvatures contouring an epithelial sheet, or stiffness of the surrounding extracellular matrix. We~identify the F-actin-capping/severing proteins Cofilin, CapZ, and Gelsolin as essential gatekeepers that limit YAP/TAZ activity in cells experiencing low mechanical stresses, including contact inhibition of proliferation. We propose that mechanical forces are overarching regulators of YAP/TAZ in multicellular contexts, setting responsiveness to Hippo, WNT, and GPCR signaling.},

During EMT, cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions are remodelled, which leads to the detachment of epithelial cells from each other and the underlying basement membrane, and a new transcriptional programme is activated to promote the mesenchymal fate. In the context of neoplasias, EMT confers on cancer cells increased tumour-initiating and metastatic potential and a greater resistance to elimination by several therapeutic regimens. In this Review, we discuss recent findings on the mechanisms and roles of EMT in normal and neoplastic tissues, and the cell-intrinsic signals that sustain expression of this programme. We also highlight how EMT gives rise to a variety of intermediate cell states between the epithelial and the mesenchymal state, which could function as cancer stem cells. In addition, we describe the contributions of the tumour microenvironment in inducing EMT and the effects of EMT on the immunobiology of carcinomas.},

In this article we have analyzed the factors controlling Zeb1 expression during EMT. In NMuMG cells treated with TGF-{$\beta$}, Snail1 RNA and protein are induced 1 h after addition of the cytokine preceding Zeb1 up-regulation that requires 6-8 h. Zeb1 gene expression is caused by increased RNA levels but also by enhanced protein stability and is markedly dependent on Snail1 because depletion of this protein prevents Zeb1 protein and RNA up-regulation. In addition to Snail1, depletion of the Twist transcriptional factor retards Zeb1 stimulation by TGF-{$\beta$} or decreases Zeb1 expression in other cellular models indicating that this factor is also required for Zeb1 expression. Accordingly, Snail1 and Twist cooperate in the induction of Zeb1: co-transfection of both cDNAs is required for the maximal expression of ZEB1 mRNA. Unexpectedly, the expression of Snail1 and Twist shows a mutual dependence although to a different extent; whereas Twist depletion retards Snail1 up-regulation by TGF-{$\beta$}, Snail1 is necessary for the rapid increase in Twist protein and later up-regulation of Twist1 mRNA induced by the cytokine. Besides this effect on Twist, Snail1 also induces the nuclear translocation of Ets1, another factor required for Zeb1 expression. Both Twist and Ets1 bind to the ZEB1 promoter although to different elements: whereas Ets1 interacts with the proximal promoter, Twist does it with a 700-bp sequence upstream of the transcription start site. These results indicate that Snail1 controls Zeb1 expression at multiple levels and acts cooperatively with Twist in the ZEB1 gene transcription induction.},

  abstract = {One of the hallmarks of cancers is the silencing of tumour suppressor genes and pathways. The Hippo tumour suppressor pathway is inactivated in many types of cancers, leading to tumour progression and metastasis. However, the mechanisms of pathway inactivation in tumours remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that integrin-linked kinase (ILK) plays a critical role in the suppression of the Hippo pathway via phospho-inhibition of MYPT1-PP1, leading to inactivation of Merlin. Inhibition of ILK in breast, prostate and colon tumour cells results in the activation of the Hippo pathway components MST1 and LATS1 with concomitant inactivation of YAP/TAZ (Yes-associated protein/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) transcriptional co-activators and TEAD-mediated transcription. Genetic deletion of ILK suppresses ErbB2-driven YAP/TAZ activation in mammary tumours, and its pharmacological inhibition suppresses YAP activation and tumour growth in vivo. Our data demonstrate a role for ILK as a multiple receptor proximal regulator of Hippo tumour suppressor pathway and as a cancer therapeutic target.},

VICs and VECs were isolated from the porcine aortic valve and techniques were developed for the isolation of CEM for cell culture. VECs and VICs cultured on CEM adhered and proliferated, maintaining their phenotypic morphology. VECs synthesised von Willebrand factor mRNA and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA and expressed eNOS and VICs synthesised alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) mRNA and expressed alphaSMA. Cellular area fraction of VICs expressing alphaSMA was 87.7+/-6.8\% and cellular area fraction of VECs expressing eNOS was 93.8+/-9.3\%. Findings of this study support the hypothesis that CEM is a potential biomaterial for tissue engineered heart valve scaffold design.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is ubiquitous and generally regarded as a key mechanism for enabling organisms to survive in the face of environmental change. Because no organism is infinitely or ideally plastic, theory suggests that there must be limits (for example, the lack of ability to produce an optimal trait) to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, or that plasticity may have inherent significant costs. Yet numerous experimental studies have not detected widespread costs. Explicitly differentiating plasticity costs from phenotype costs, we re-evaluate fundamental questions of the limits to the evolution of plasticity and of generalists vs specialists. We advocate for the view that relaxed selection and variable selection intensities are likely more important constraints to the evolution of plasticity than the costs of plasticity. Some forms of plasticity, such as learning, may be inherently costly. In addition, we examine opportunities to offset costs of phenotypes through ontogeny, amelioration of phenotypic costs across environments, and the condition-dependent hypothesis. We propose avenues of further inquiry in the limits of plasticity using new and classic methods of ecological parameterization, phylogenetics and omics in the context of answering questions on the constraints of plasticity. Given plasticity's key role in coping with environmental change, approaches spanning the spectrum from applied to basic will greatly enrich our understanding of the evolution of plasticity and resolve our understanding of limits.},

However, such simple 1:1 mapping must now give place to the modern concepts of gene regulatory networks and gene expression noise. Both can, in the absence of genetic mutations, jointly generate a diversity of inheritable randomly occupied phenotypic states that could also serve as a substrate for natural selection. This form of epigenetic dynamics challenges Neo-Darwinism. It needs to incorporate the non-linear, stochastic dynamics of gene networks. A first step is to consider the mathematical correspondence between gene regulatory networks and Waddington's metaphoric 'epigenetic landscape', which actually represents the quasi-potential function of global network dynamics. It explains the coexistence of multiple stable phenotypes within one genotype. The landscape's topography with its attractors is shaped by evolution through mutational re-wiring of regulatory interactions - offering a link between genetic mutation and sudden, broad evolutionary changes.},

Constitutive production of p52 has been suggested as a major mechanism underlying lymphomagenesis induced by NF-kappaB2 mutations, which occur recurrently in a variety of human lymphoid malignancies. To test the hypothesis, we generated transgenic mice with targeted expression of p52 in lymphocytes. In contrast to their counterparts expressing the tumor-derived NF-kappaB2 mutant p80HT, which develop predominantly B cell tumors, p52 transgenic mice are not prone to lymphomagenesis. However, they are predisposed to inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by multiorgan infiltration of activated lymphocytes, high levels of autoantibodies in the serum, and immune complex glomerulonephritis. p52, but not p80HT, represses Bim expression, leading to defects in apoptotic processes critical for elimination of autoreactive lymphocytes and control of immune response. These findings reveal distinct signaling pathways for actions of NF-kappaB2 mutants and p52 and suggest a causal role for sustained NF-kappaB2 activation in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.},

Ras activation via RasGRP alone is analog (graded increase in amplitude with stimulus). We describe how complementary analog (RasGRP) and digital (SOS) pathways act on Ras to efficiently convert analog input to digital output.

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that constantly fuse with one another and subsequently break apart. Defective or superfluous mitochondria are usually eliminated by a form of autophagy, referred to as mitophagy, to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. Mitochondrial dynamics are tightly regulated by processes including fusion and fission. Dysfunction of mitochondrial dynamics can lead to the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria and contribute to cellular damage. Neurons are among the cell types that consume the most energy, have a highly complex morphology, and are particularly dependent on mitochondrial functions and dynamics. In this review article, we summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying the mitochondrial dynamics and the regulation of mitophagy and discuss the dysfunction of these processes in the progression of prion diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders. We have also provided an overview of mitochondrial dynamics as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.},

Recently, molecular links between these two cyclic processes have been discovered. Core clock transcription factors, Bmal1 and Clock (Clk), directly regulate Wee1 kinase, which inhibits entry into the mitosis. We investigate the effect of this connection on the timing of mammalian cell cycle processes with computational modeling tools. We connect a minimal model of circadian rhythms, which consists of transcription-translation feedback loops, with a modified mammalian cell cycle model from Novak and Tyson (2004). As we vary the mass doubling time (MDT) of the cell cycle, stochastic simulations reveal quantized cell cycles when the activity of Wee1 is influenced by clock components. The quantized cell cycles disappear in the absence of coupling or when the strength of this link is reduced. More intriguingly, our simulations indicate that the circadian clock triggers critical size control in the mammalian cell cycle. A periodic brake on the cell cycle progress via Wee1 enforces size control when the MDT is quite different from the circadian period. No size control is observed in the absence of coupling. The issue of size control in the mammalian system is debatable, whereas it is well established in yeast. It is possible that the size control is more readily observed in cell lines that contain circadian rhythms, since not all cell types have a circadian clock. This would be analogous to an ultradian clock intertwined with quantized cell cycles (and possibly cell size control) in yeast. We present the first coupled model between the mammalian cell cycle and circadian rhythms that reveals quantized cell cycles and cell size control influenced by the clock.},

The origin of the SM-like cells and the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of this remodelling process are not understood. Endothelial cells within the intima may migrate from their organised layer of cells and transition to mesenchymal or SM-like phenotype in a process called endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EnMT). Traditionally, Waddington's epigenetic landscape illustrates that fates of somatic cells are progressively determined to compulsorily follow a downhill differentiation pathway. EnMT induces the transformation of cells with stem cell traits, therefore contrasting Waddington's theory and confirming that cell fate seems to be far more flexible than previously thought. The prospect of therapeutic inhibition of EnMT to delay or prevent PH may represent a promising new treatment modality.},

We have extended these observations by investigating two N-terminal phosphorylation sites in Myc, Thr 58 and Ser 62, which are known to be regulated by mitogen stimulation. We now show that the phosphorylation of these two residues is critical for determining the stability of Myc. Phosphorylation of Ser 62 is required for Ras-induced stabilization of Myc, likely mediated through the action of ERK. Conversely, phosphorylation of Thr 58, likely mediated by GSK-3 but dependent on the prior phosphorylation of Ser 62, is associated with degradation of Myc. Further analysis demonstrates that the Ras-dependent PI-3K pathway is also critical for controlling Myc protein accumulation, likely through the control of GSK-3 activity. These observations thus define a synergistic role for multiple Ras-mediated phosphorylation pathways in the control of Myc protein accumulation during the initial stage of cell proliferation.},

  abstract = {Upon nutritional limitation, the bacterium Bacillus subtilis has the capability to enter the irreversible process of sporulation. This developmental process is bistable, and only a subpopulation of cells actually differentiates into endospores. Why a cell decides to sporulate or not to do so is poorly understood. Here, through the use of time-lapse microscopy, we follow the growth, division, and differentiation of individual cells to identify elements of cell history and ancestry that could affect this decision process. These analyses show that during microcolony development, B. subtilis uses a bet-hedging strategy whereby some cells sporulate while others use alternative metabolites to continue growth, providing the latter subpopulation with a reproductive advantage. We demonstrate that B. subtilis is subject to aging. Nevertheless, the age of the cell plays no role in the decision of its fate. However, the physiological state of the cell's ancestor (more than two generations removed) does affect the outcome of cellular differentiation. We show that this epigenetic inheritance is based on positive feedback within the sporulation phosphorelay. The extended intergenerational "memory" caused by this autostimulatory network may be important for the development of multicellular structures such as fruiting bodies and biofilms.},

  abstract = {Somatic cell reprogramming has dramatically changed stem cell research in recent years. The high pace of new findings in the field and an ever increasing amount of data from new high throughput techniques make it challenging to isolate core principles of the process. In order to analyze such mechanisms, we developed an abstract mechanistic model of a subset of the known regulatory processes during cell differentiation and production of induced pluripotent stem cells. This probabilistic Boolean network describes the interplay between gene expression, chromatin modifications, and DNA methylation. The model incorporates recent findings in epigenetics and partially reproduces experimentally observed reprogramming efficiencies and changes in methylation and chromatin remodeling. It enables us to investigate, how the temporal progression of the process is regulated. It also explicitly includes the transduction of factors using viral vectors and their silencing in reprogrammed cells, since this is still a standard procedure in somatic cell reprogramming. Based on the model we calculate an epigenetic landscape for probabilities of cell states. Simulation results show good reproduction of experimental observations during reprogramming, despite the simple structure of the model. An extensive analysis and introduced variations hint toward possible optimizations of the process that could push the technique closer to clinical applications. Faster changes in DNA methylation increase the speed of reprogramming at the expense of efficiency, while accelerated chromatin modifications moderately improve efficiency.},

  abstract = {BI 2536 is a new anti-mitotic drug that targets polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and is currently under clinical development for cancer therapy. The effect of this drug on cancer cells has been extensively investigated, but information about the effects on primary dividing cells and differentiated non-dividing cells is scarce. We have investigated the effects of this drug on primary neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts and on differentiated cardiomyocytes and explored the possibility to use this drug to enrich differentiated cell populations in vitro. BI 2536 had a profound effect on cardiac fibroblast proliferation in vitro and arrested these cells in mitosis with an IC50 of about 43 nM. Similar results were observed with primary human cells (HUVEC, IC50 {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 30 nM), whereas the cancer cell line HeLa was more sensitive (IC50 of 9 nM). Further analysis revealed that prolonged mitotic arrest resulted in cell death for about 40\% of cardiac fibroblasts. The remaining cells showed an interphase morphology with mostly multi- and micro-nucleated nuclei. This indicates that a significant number of primary fibroblasts are able to escape BI 2536 induced mitotic arrest and apparently become aneuploid. No effects were observed on cardiomyocytes and hypertrophic response (growth) upon endothelin-1 and phenylephrine stimulation was normal in the presence of BI 2536. This indicates that BI 2536 has no adverse effects on terminally differentiated cells and still allows proliferation independent growth induction in these cells. In conclusion, cardiomyocytes could be enriched using BI 2536, but the formation of aneuploidy in proliferating cells most likely limits this in vitro application and does not allow its use in putative cell based therapies.},

This work aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which TGFbeta3 brings about palatal seam EMT. We collected mRNA for PCR analysis from individual transforming MEE cells by laser microdissection techniques and demonstrated that TGFbeta3 stimulates lymphoid-enhancing factor 1 (LEF1) mRNA synthesis in MEE cells. We show with antisense beta-catenin oligonucleotides that up-regulated LEF1 is not activated by beta-catenin in palate EMT. We ruled out other TGFbeta3 targets, such as RhoA and MEK1/2 pathways, and we present evidence using dominant-negative Smad4 and dominant-negative LEF1 showing that TGFbeta3 uses Smads both to up-regulate synthesis of LEF1 and to activate LEF1 transcription during induction of palatal EMT. When phospho-Smad2 and Smad4 are present in the nucleus, LEF1 is activated without beta-catenin. Our paper is the first to show that the Smad2,4/LEF1 complex replaces beta-catenin/LEF1 during activation of EMT in vivo by TGFbeta3.},

Here, we examined whether other apoptotic proteinases initiated DNA fragmentation via DFF45/ICAD inactivation. In a cell-free assay, caspases-3, -6, -7, -8, and granzyme B initiated benzoyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) cleaving caspase activity, DFF45/ICAD inactivation, and DNA fragmentation, but calpain and cathepsin D failed to initiate these events. Strikingly, only the DEVD cleaving caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, inactivated DFF45/ICAD and promoted DNA fragmentation in an in vitro DFF40/CAD assay, suggesting that granzyme B, caspase-6, and caspase-8 promote DFF45/ICAD inactivation and DNA fragmentation indirectly by activating caspase-3 and/or caspase-7. In vitro, however, caspase-3 inactivated DFF45/ICAD and promoted DNA fragmentation more effectively than caspase-7 and endogenous levels of caspase-7 failed to inactivate DFF45/ICAD in caspase-3 null MCF7 cells and extracts. Together, these data suggest that caspase-3 is the primary inactivator of DFF45/ICAD and therefore the primary activator of apoptotic DNA fragmentation.},

Although defects of the mitotic spindle checkpoint are thought to play a role in the genesis of chromosome instability, we previously reported its frequent impairment in human lung cancer cell lines. In this study, we examined a panel of 13 human cancer cell lines comprising 11 lung and 2 other cancers and found a significant difference in the resistance to apoptosis induced by anti-microtubule agents between mitotic spindle checkpoint-impaired and -proficient cancer cell lines. This finding was in marked contrast to a lack of such correlation with a DNA damaging agent, cis-platin. Interestingly, anti-microtubule agent-induced apoptosis in mitotic spindle checkpoint-proficient cell lines, NCI-H460 and A549, was shown to be markedly reduced by staurosporine treatment in association with the shortened mitotic arrest, whereas various inhibitors of caspases seemed to have very modest effects. Taken together, these findings suggest the potential involvement of mitotic spindle checkpoint in the induction of apoptosis by anti-microtubule agents in human lung cancers, warranting further studies on the underlying mechanisms.},

We find that the Fas-induced activation of cdc2 and cdk2 in Jurkat cells is not dependent on protein synthesis, which is shut down very early during apoptosis before caspase-3 activation. Instead, activation of these kinases seems to result from both a rapid cleavage of Wee1 (an inhibitory kinase of cdc2 and cdk2) and inactivation of anaphase-promoting complex (the specific system for cyclin degradation), in which CDC27 homolog is cleaved during apoptosis. Both Wee1 and CDC27 are shown to be substrates of the caspase-3-like protease. Although cdk activities are elevated during Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, general activation of the mitotic processes does not occur. Our results do not support the idea that apoptosis is simply an aberrant mitosis but, instead, suggest that a subset of mitotic mechanisms plays an important role in apoptosis through elevated cdk activities.},

Recent studies have indicated that the miR-200 family may exert their effects at distinct stages in the metastatic process, with an overall effect of enhancing metastasis in a syngeneic mouse breast cancer model. We find in a xenograft orthotopic model of breast cancer metastasis that ectopic expression of members of the miR-200b/200c/429, but not the miR-141/200a, functional groups limits tumour cell invasion and metastasis. Despite modulation of the ZEB1-E-cadherin axis, restoration of ZEB1 in miR-200b-expressing cells was not able to alter metastatic potential suggesting that other targets contribute to this process. Instead, we found that miR-200b repressed several actin-associated genes, with the knockdown of the ezrin-radixin-moesin family member moesin alone phenocopying the repression of cell invasion by miR-200b. Moesin was verified to be directly targeted by miR-200b, and restoration of moesin in miR-200b-expressing cells was sufficient to alleviate metastatic repression. In breast cancer cell lines and patient samples, the expression of moesin significantly inversely correlated with miR-200 expression, and high levels of moesin were associated with poor relapse-free survival. These findings highlight the context-dependent effects of miR-200 in breast cancer metastasis and demonstrate the existence of a moesin-dependent pathway, distinct from the ZEB1-E-cadherin axis, through which miR-200 can regulate tumour cell plasticity and metastasis.},

  abstract = {This chapter focuses on evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity in plants. The expression of an individual genotype is modified by its environment. The amount by which it can be modified is termed its plasticity. This plasticity can be either morphological or physiological; these are interrelated. The plasticity of a character is related to the general pattern of its development, and apart from this, that plasticity is a general property of the whole genotype. Plasticity of a character appears to be specific for that character, specific in relation to particular environmental influences, specific in direction, under genetic control not necessarily related to heterozygosity, and able to be radically altered by selection. Because plants are static organisms, plasticity is of marked adaptive value in a great number of situations. Examples of all these situations in plant species are discussed. They indicate that adaptation by plasticity is a widespread and important phenomenon in plants and has evolved differently in different species. The mechanisms involved in plasticity are varied. At one extreme, the character shows a continuous range of modification dependent on the intensity of the environmental stimulus. At the other, the character shows only two discrete modifications. The stimulus causing these modifications may be direct or indirect. The mechanisms found can be related to the particular environmental situation involved.},

  abstract = {Metastatic cancer is extremely difficult to treat, and the presence of metastases greatly reduces a cancer patient's likelihood of long-term survival. The ZEB1 transcriptional repressor promotes metastasis through downregulation of microRNAs (miRs) that are strong inducers of epithelial differentiation and inhibitors of stem cell factors. Given that each miR can target multiple genes with diverse functions, we posited that the prometastatic network controlled by ZEB1 extends beyond these processes. We tested this hypothesis using a mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma metastasis driven by ZEB1, human lung carcinoma cells, and human breast carcinoma cells. Transcriptional profiling studies revealed that ZEB1 controls the expression of numerous oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRs, including miR-34a. Ectopic expression of miR-34a decreased tumor cell invasion and metastasis, inhibited the formation of promigratory cytoskeletal structures, suppressed activation of the RHO GTPase family, and regulated a gene expression signature enriched in cytoskeletal functions and predictive of outcome in human lung adenocarcinomas. We identified several miR-34a target genes, including Arhgap1, which encodes a RHO GTPase activating protein that was required for tumor cell invasion. These findings demonstrate that ZEB1 drives prometastatic actin cytoskeletal remodeling by downregulating miR-34a expression and provide a compelling rationale to develop miR-34a as a therapeutic agent in lung cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Cell cycle progression is a process that is tightly controlled by internal and external signals. Environmental cues, such as those provided by growth factors, activate early signals that promote cell cycle entry. Cells that have progressed past the restriction point become independent of growth factors, and cell cycle progression is then controlled endogenously. The phosphatidylinositol 3OH kinase (PI(3)K)/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway must be activated in G1 to inactivate forkhead transcription factors (FKH-TFs) and allow cell cycle entry. Here we show that subsequent attenuation of the PI(3)K/PKB pathway is required to allow transcriptional activation of FKH-TF in G2. FKH-TF activity in G2 controls mammalian cell cycle termination, as interference with FKH transcriptional activation by disrupting PI(3)K/PKB downregulation, or by expressing a transcriptionally inactive FKH mutant, induces cell accumulation in G2/M, defective cytokinesis, and delayed transition from M to G1 of the cell cycle. We demonstrate that FKH-TFs regulate expression of mitotic genes such as cyclin B and polo-like kinase (Plk). Our results support the important role of forkhead in the control of mammalian cell cycle completion, and suggest that efficient execution of the mitotic programme depends on downregulation of PI(3)K/PKB and consequent induction of FKH transcriptional activity.},

  abstract = {It is common knowledge that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a critical regulator of mesenchymal cell migration and proliferation. Nevertheless, these two cellular responses are mutually exclusive. To solve this apparent contradiction, we studied the behavior of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in response to increasing concentrations of PDGF. We found that there is strong cell proliferation induction only with PDGF concentrations {$>$}5 ng/ml, whereas the cell migration response arises starting from 1 ng/ml and is negligible at higher PDGF concentrations. According to these phenotypic evidences, our data indicate that cells display a differential activation of the main signaling pathways in response to PDGF as a function of the stimulation dose. At low PDGF concentrations, there is maximal activation of signaling pathways linked to cytoskeleton rearrangement needed for cell motility, whereas high PDGF concentrations activate pathways linked to mitogenesis induction. Our results suggest a mechanism by which cells switch from a migrating to a proliferating phenotype sensing the increasing gradient of PDGF. In addition, we propose that the cell decision to proliferate or migrate relies on different endocytotic routes of the PDGF receptor in response to different PDGF concentrations.},

The effects of Fas-ligand (FasL) treatment and inhibition of Fas signalling on GI cancer cells were tested using invasion assay, immunofluorescence, immunoblot, Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyse the EMT-associated molecules in GI cancer specimens. FasL treatment inhibited E-cadherin transcription by upregulation of Snail in GI cancer cells. The nuclear expression and transcriptional activity of Snail and {$\beta$}-catenin were increased by inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3{$\beta$}) at Ser9 by FasL-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling. Snail associated with {$\beta$}-catenin in the nucleus and, thus, increased {$\beta$}-catenin transcriptional activity. Evaluation of human GI cancer specimens showed that the expression of FasL, phospho-GSK-3{$\beta$}, Snail and {$\beta$}-catenin increase during GI cancer progression. An EMT phenotype was shown to correlate with an advanced cancer stage, and a non-EMT phenotype significantly correlated with a better prognosis. Collectively, these data indicate that GSK-3{$\beta$} regulates Snail and {$\beta$}-catenin expression during Fas-induced EMT in gastrointestinal cancer.},

This description reflects the inherently stochastic nature of gene expression, known to be a major factor in the heterogeneous response of individual cells within a clonal population to an inducing stimulus. Here we show in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that stochasticity (noise) arising from transcription contributes significantly to the level of heterogeneity within a eukaryotic clonal population, in contrast to observations in prokaryotes, and that such noise can be modulated at the translational level. We use a stochastic model of transcription initiation specific to eukaryotes to show that pulsatile mRNA production, through reinitiation, is crucial for the dependence of noise on transcriptional efficiency, highlighting a key difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources of noise. Furthermore, we explore the propagation of noise in a gene cascade network and demonstrate experimentally that increased noise in the transcription of a regulatory protein leads to increased cell-cell variability in the target gene output, resulting in prolonged bistable expression states. This result has implications for the role of noise in phenotypic variation and cellular differentiation.},

  abstract = {When exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a closely related death ligand and investigational therapeutic, cells enter a protracted period of variable duration in which only upstream initiator caspases are active. A subsequent and sudden transition marks activation of the downstream effector caspases that rapidly dismantle the cell. Thus, extrinsic apoptosis is controlled by an unusual variable-delay, snap-action switch that enforces an unambiguous choice between life and death. To understand how the extrinsic apoptosis switch functions in quantitative terms, we constructed a mathematical model based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways. The model was trained against experimental data obtained by live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression. The trained model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, making it possible to study switching mechanisms in detail. Model analysis shows, and experiments confirm, that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase-8 activity and the rates of other reactions lying immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. Sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved downstream by reactions involved in permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. We find that the pattern of interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly are all critical for snap-action control.},

APC/C(CDC20) ubiquitinates a limited set of substrates for subsequent degradation, including Cyclin B1 and Securin, whereas APC/C(CDH1) has a broader specificity. This switch depends on dephosphorylation of CDH1 and the APC/C, and on the degradation of CDC20. Here we show, in human cells, that the APC/C inhibitor MAD2L2 also contributes to ensuring the sequential activation of the APC/C by CDC20 and CDH1. In prometaphase, MAD2L2 sequestered free CDH1 away from the APC/C. At the onset of anaphase, MAD2L2 was rapidly degraded by APC/C(CDC20), releasing CDH1 to activate the dephosphorylated APC/C. Loss of MAD2L2 led to premature association of CDH1 with the APC/C, early destruction of APC/C(CDH1) substrates, and accelerated mitosis with frequent mitotic aberrations. Thus, MAD2L2 helps to ensure a robustly bistable switch between APC/C(CDC20) and APC/C(CDH1) during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, thereby contributing to mitotic fidelity.},

The G1 cell cycle arrest is in part caused by the p53-dependent transcriptional activation of the CDK inhibitor, p21(Cip1/Waf1). We report here that human p21 protein is rapidly induced but selectively cleaved during the apoptotic response to gamma-irradiation. Such an event occurred early, well before the morphological appearance of apoptosis. Ectopical expression of p53 in tumor cells alone could induce p21 expression, followed by p21 cleavage and apoptosis. The cleavage of p21 could be reproduced in extracts prepared from irradiated cells or by recombinant caspase-3, suggesting that a caspase-like activity is responsible for this cleavage. p21 binds independently to both CDK2 and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Our studies indicated that p21 cleavage by the caspase-like activity specifically abolished its interaction with PCNA, suggesting that p21 cleavage may interfere with normal PCNA-dependent repair. Our data suggest that p21 may serve as a critical checkpoint regulator for both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis during the p53-mediated DNA damage response. Manipulation of the checkpoint regulators involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis may thus provide a novel strategy to cancer therapy.},

In order to "trap" and identify the apoptotic signals upstream of mitochondrial permeabilization, we challenged Bax-/- Bak-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts with pharmacological inducers of ER stress. We found that ER stress induces proteolytic activation of the BH3-only protein BID as a critical apoptotic switch. Moreover, we identified caspase-2 as the premitochondrial protease that cleaves BID in response to ER stress and showed that resistance to ER stress-induced apoptosis can be conferred by inhibiting caspase-2 activity.

Here, we show that Snail and Slug promote formation of beta-catenin-T-cell factor (TCF)-4 transcription complexes that bind to the promoter of the TGF-beta3 gene to increase its transcription. Subsequent transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta3 signaling increases LEF-1 gene expression causing formation of beta-catenin-lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)-1 complexes that initiate EMT. TGF-beta1 or TGF-beta2 stimulates this signaling mechanism by up-regulating synthesis of Snail and Slug. TGF-beta1- and TGF-beta2-induced EMT were found to be TGF-beta3 dependent, establishing essential roles for multiple TGF-beta isoforms. Finally, we determined that beta-catenin-LEF-1 complexes can promote EMT without upstream signaling pathways. These findings provide evidence for a unified signaling mechanism driven by convergence of multiple TGF-beta and TCF signaling molecules that confers loss of cell-cell adhesion and acquisition of the mesenchymal phenotype.},

  abstract = {Loss of growth inhibitory responses to the cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in cancer cells may result from mutational inactivation of TGF-beta receptors or their signal transducers, the Smad transcription factors. In breast cancer, however, loss of TGF-beta growth inhibition often occurs without a loss of these signaling components. A genome-wide analysis of rapid TGF-beta gene responses in MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells shows that c-myc repression, a response that is key to the TGF-beta program of cell cycle arrest, is selectively lost in the cancer cell line. Transformation of MCF-10A cells with c-Ha-ras and c-erbB2 oncogenes also led to a selective loss of c-myc repression and cell cycle arrest response. TGF-beta stimulation of epithelial cells rapidly induces the formation of a Smad complex that specifically recognizes a TGF-beta inhibitory element in the c-myc promoter. Formation of this complex is deficient in the oncogenically transformed breast cells. These results suggest that a Smad complex that specifically mediates c-myc repression is a target of oncogenic signals in breast cancer.},

Here, we identify a synergistic induction of apoptosis by BI 6727 and several microtubule-interfering drugs in ES cells, including vincristine (VCR), vinblastine (VBL), vinorelbine (VNR) and eribulin. Synergistic drug interaction is confirmed by calculation of combination index (CI). Also, BI 6727 and VCR act in concert to reduce long-term clonogenic survival. Mechanistically, BI 6727/VCR co-treatment cooperates to trigger mitotic arrest, phosphorylation of BCL-2 and BCL-XL and downregulation of MCL-1. This inactivation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins in turn promotes activation of BAX and BAK, activation of caspase-9 and -3 and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Overexpression of BCL-2 or simultaneous knockdown of BAX and BAK significantly rescue BI 6727/VCR-induced apoptosis, indicating that engagement of the mitochondrial pathway is critical for BI 6727/VCR-mediated apoptosis. The clinical relevance of PLK1 inhibitor-based combination therapies is underscored by the fact that BI 6727 is currently evaluated in phase I clinical trials in childhood cancer. In conclusion, PLK1 inhibitors such as BI 6727 may provide a new strategy to chemosensitize ES.},

  abstract = {Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) regulates essential cellular functions such as cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Multiple apoptotic mediators and signaling pathways have been implicated in TGFbeta-induced apoptosis. Bim, a BH3-only protein, is critical for apoptosis in a variety of cell types. In resting cells, BimEL expression levels, the major and most abundant isoform, are controlled by Erk1/2-mediated phosphorylation, which targets BimEL for ubiquitination and degradation. We previously reported that TGFbeta induces the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim through a Smad3-dependent mechanism to induce cell death in B-lymphocytes. A number of studies have shown TGFbeta to cause transcriptional induction of Bim in many cell types. Recently, we demonstrated that, in addition to its transcriptional effects on Bim, TGFbeta induces a MAPK phosphatase (MKP), MKP2/DUSP4, to rapidly increase BimEL levels by inactivation of Erk1/2, resulting in dephosphorylation and escape of BimEL from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Our findings are of importance not only in the context that we implicate TGFbeta to increase BimEL levels through both an immediate post-translational regulatory mechanism and a long-term effect through transcriptional induction, but also in the context of implicating MKPs as regulatory players in apoptosis. Here we summarize these recent findings and their significance to our understanding of how TGFbeta mediates apoptosis, and we explore the possible regulatory mechanisms controlling Bim expression levels.},

Two key cellular plasticity mechanisms -Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Mesenchymal-to-Amoeboid Transition (MAT) - have been carefully investigated individually, yet a comprehensive understanding of their interconnections remains elusive. Previously, we have modeled the dynamics of the core regulatory circuits for both EMT (miR-200/ZEB/miR-34/SNAIL) and MAT (Rac1/RhoA). We now extend our previous work to study the coupling between these two core circuits by considering the two microRNAs (miR-200 and miR-34) as external signals to the core MAT circuit. We show that this coupled circuit enables four different stable steady states (phenotypes) that correspond to hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M), mesenchymal (M), amoeboid (A) and hybrid amoeboid/mesenchymal (A/M) phenotypes. Our model recapitulates the metastasis-suppressing role of the microRNAs even in the presence of EMT-inducing signals like Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). It also enables mapping the microRNA levels to the transitions among various cell migration phenotypes. Finally, it offers a mechanistic understanding for the observed phenotypic transitions among different cell migration phenotypes, specifically the Collective-to-Amoeboid Transition (CAT).},

Loss of p53 function increased canonical Wnt signaling by alleviating miR-34-specific interactions with target UTRs, and miR-34 depletion relieved p53-mediated Wnt repression. Gene expression signatures reflecting the status of {$\beta$}-catenin-TCF/LEF transcriptional activity in breast cancer and pediatric neuroblastoma patients were correlated with p53 and miR-34 functional status. Loss of p53 or miR-34 contributed to neoplastic progression by triggering the Wnt-dependent, tissue-invasive activity of colorectal cancer cells. Further, during development, miR-34 interactions with the {$\beta$}-catenin UTR affected Xenopus body axis polarity and the expression of Wnt-dependent patterning genes. These data provide insight into the mechanisms by which a p53-miR-34 network restrains canonical Wnt signaling cascades in developing organisms and human cancer.},

Overexpression of Aurora-A in tumour cells has been correlated with cancer susceptibility and poor prognosis. Aurora-A activity is required for the recruitment of CDK1-cyclin B1 to the centrosome prior to its activation and the commitment of the cell to mitosis. In this report, we demonstrate that the CDC25B phosphatase, an activator of cyclin dependent kinases at mitosis, is phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo by Aurora-A on serine 353 and that this phosphorylated form of CDC25B is located at the centrosome during mitosis. Knockdown experiments by RNAi confirm that the centrosome phosphorylation of CDC25B on S353 depends on Aurora-A kinase. Microinjection of antibodies against phosphorylated S353 results in a mitotic delay whilst overexpression of a S353 phosphomimetic mutant enhances the mitotic inducing effect of CDC25B. Our results demonstrate that Aurora-A phosphorylates CDC25B in vivo at the centrosome during mitosis. This phosphorylation might locally participate in the control of the onset of mitosis. These findings re-emphasise the role of the centrosome as a functional integrator of the pathways contributing to the triggering of mitosis.},

We report a relationship between mitochondrial form and cell cycle control at the G(1)-S boundary. Mitochondria convert from isolated, fragmented elements into a hyperfused, giant network at G(1)-S transition. The network is electrically continuous and has greater ATP output than mitochondria at any other cell cycle stage. Depolarizing mitochondria at early G(1) to prevent these changes causes cell cycle progression into S phase to be blocked. Inducing mitochondrial hyperfusion by acute inhibition of dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP1) causes quiescent cells maintained without growth factors to begin replicating their DNA and coincides with buildup of cyclin E, the cyclin responsible for G(1)-to-S phase progression. Prolonged or untimely formation of hyperfused mitochondria, through chronic inhibition of DRP1, causes defects in mitotic chromosome alignment and S-phase entry characteristic of cyclin E overexpression. These findings suggest a hyperfused mitochondrial system with specialized properties at G(1)-S is linked to cyclin E buildup for regulation of G(1)-to-S progression.},

In our present study, we provide novel finding that, in breast cancer, the ectopic expression of deltaEF1 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly promoted cell proliferation by increasing the cell number in S phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, deltaEF1 knockdown by RNA interference exhibited an opposite effect, highlighting a potent role of deltaEF1 to promote G1-S transition of breast cancer cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that deltaEF1 down-regulated p21 and concurrently up-regulated the expressions of CDK2 and CDK4 during this process. Further, deltaEF1 inhibited p21 transcription by recruiting to the E(2) box element on the p21 promoter. Depletion of endogenous deltaEF1 in MDA-MB-231 cells was sufficient to allow an inherent release of p21 expression, thus resulting in the cell cycle arrest. In addition, the stimulatory effect of deltaEF1 on cell proliferation through p21 regulation was supported by an inverse correlation of deltaEF1 and p21 expressions observed in both breast cancer cell lines and clinical tumor specimens. Taken together, these observations suggest a dual effect of deltaEF1 in promoting breast cancer cell proliferation, by differentially regulating the cell cycle regulatory proteins.},

We further demonstrate that this behavior depends on the mechano-sensitivity of the transcription regulator YAP and two new YAP-mediated cross-regulating feedback mechanisms: Wilms Tumor-1-YAP-mediated downregulation of E-cadherin, loosening cell-cell contacts, and YAP-TRIO-Merlin mediated regulation of Rho GTPase family proteins, enhancing cell migration.

Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed this prediction. The stimulus/response curve of the MAPK was found to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 4-5, well in excess of that of the classical allosteric protein hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK stimulus/ response curve may make the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and oocyte maturation, where a cell switches from one discrete state to another.},

In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to the CED-4 homologue, Apaf-1, thereby triggering Apaf-1-mediated activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 is thought to propagate the death signal by triggering other caspase activation events, the details of which remain obscure. Here, we report that six additional caspases (caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -10) are processed in cell-free extracts in response to cytochrome c, and that three others (caspases-1, -4, and -5) failed to be activated under the same conditions. In vitro association assays confirmed that caspase-9 selectively bound to Apaf-1, whereas caspases-1, -2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -10 did not. Depletion of caspase-9 from cell extracts abrogated cytochrome c-inducible activation of caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -10, suggesting that caspase-9 is required for all of these downstream caspase activation events. Immunodepletion of caspases-3, -6, and -7 from cell extracts enabled us to order the sequence of caspase activation events downstream of caspase-9 and reveal the presence of a branched caspase cascade. Caspase-3 is required for the activation of four other caspases (-2, -6, -8, and -10) in this pathway and also participates in a feedback amplification loop involving caspase-9.},

In transient transfection assays, Bik promotes cell death in a manner similar to the death-promoting members of the Bcl-2 family, Bax and Bak. This death-promoting activity of Bik can be suppressed by coexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, EBV-BHRF1 and E1B-19 kDa proteins suggesting that Bik may be a common target for both cellular and viral anti-apoptotic proteins. While Bik does not show overt homology to the BH1 and BH2 conserved domains characteristic of the Bcl-2 family, it does share a 9 amino acid domain (BH3) with Bax and Bak which may be a critical determinant for the death-promoting activity of these proteins.},

Besides its role in angiogenesis, it is an important regulator in numerous diseases including inflammation. Ang-1-mediated Tie2 activation is required to maintain the quiescent resting state of the endothelium. Agonistic Ang-1 functions are antagonized by Ang-2, which is believed to inhibit Ang-1-Tie2 signaling. Ang-2 destabilizes the quiescent endothelium and primes it to respond to exogenous stimuli, thereby facilitating the activities of inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1) and angiogenic (vascular endothelial growth factor) cytokines. Intriguingly, Ang-2 is expressed weakly by the resting endothelium but becomes strongly upregulated following endothelial activation. Moreover, endothelial cells store Ang-2 in Weibel-Palade bodies from where it can be made available quickly following stimulation, suggesting a role of Ang-2 in controlling rapid vascular adaptive processes. This suggests that Ang-2 is the dynamic regulator of the Ang-Tie2 axis, thereby functioning as a built-in switch controlling the transition of the resting quiescent endothelium towards the activated responsive endothelium.},

However, the relationship between these families, and the signal transduction networks that control viability-regulating genes, are only beginning to be elucidated. MCL1 is a viability-promoting member of the BCL2 family that exhibits a rapid increase in expression in response to specific differentiation- and apoptosis-inducing stimuli. The signal transduction pathway involved in eliciting this increase has now been investigated. In the ML-1 human myeloblastic leukemia cell line, a rapid and sustained increase in phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) members of the MAP kinase family was found to precede the increase in MCL1 expression produced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or the microtubule-disrupting agents colchicine and vinblastine. ERK activation was necessary for the increase in MCL1, as inhibition of the increase in ERK phosphorylation (with the inhibitor PD 98059) prevented the increase in MCL1 expression and caused rapid cell death by apoptosis. In addition, other agents that markedly increased ERK phosphorylation (lipopolysaccharide, okadaic acid) also increased MCL1 expression. In contrast, agents that did not have this marked effect did not increase MCL1. Upstream components in this ERK-mediated pathway were also identified, where the pathway was found to be stimulated by microtubule disruption acting through protein kinase C (PKC). These results indicate that expression of the MCL1 viability-enhancing gene is regulated through a cytoskeletal disruption-induced ERK-mediated signal transduction pathway. They therefore suggest a mechanism through which the cytoskeleton and MAP kinases can exert effects on cell viability.},

  abstract = {Signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is positively regulated by amino acids and insulin. PRAS40 associates with mTORC1 (which contains raptor) but not mTORC2. PRAS40 interacts with raptor, and this requires an intact TOR-signaling (TOS) motif in PRAS40. Like TOS motif-containing proteins such as eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), PRAS40 is a substrate for phosphorylation by mTORC1. Consistent with this, starvation of cells of amino acids or treatment with rapamycin alters the phosphorylation of PRAS40. PRAS40 binds 14-3-3 proteins, and this requires both amino acids and insulin. Binding of PRAS40 to 14-3-3 proteins is inhibited by TSC1/2 (negative regulators of mTORC1) and stimulated by Rheb in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. This confirms that PRAS40 is a target for regulation by mTORC1. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PRAS40 impairs both the amino acid- and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the phosphorylation of S6. However, this has no effect on the phosphorylation of Akt or TSC2 (an Akt substrate). These data place PRAS40 downstream of mTORC1 but upstream of its effectors, such as S6K1 and 4E-BP1.},

Microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) of lymph channels (LECs) are difficult to distinguish from those of blood vessels (BECs) because both express a similar set of markers, such as CD31, CD34, podocalyxin, von Willebrand factor (vWF), etc. Analysis of the specific properties of LECs was hampered so far by lack of tools to isolate LECs. Recently, the 38-kD mucoprotein podoplanin was found to be expressed by microvascular LECs but not BECs in vivo. Here we isolated for the first time podoplanin(+) LECs and podoplanin(-) BECs from dermal cell suspensions by multicolor flow cytometry. Both EC types were propagated and stably expressed VE-cadherin, CD31, and vWF. Molecules selectively displayed by LECs in vivo, i.e., podoplanin, the hyaluronate receptor LYVE-1, and the vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)-C receptor, fms-like tyrosine kinase 4 (Flt-4)/VEGFR-3, were strongly expressed by expanded LECs, but not BECs. Conversely, BECs but not LECs expressed VEGF-C. LECs as well as BECs formed junctional contacts with similar molecular composition and ultrastructural features. Nevertheless, the two EC types assembled in vitro in vascular tubes in a strictly homotypic fashion. This EC specialization extends to the secretion of biologically relevant chemotactic factors: LECs, but not BECs, constitutively secrete the CC chemokine receptor (CCR)7 ligand secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC)/CCL21 at their basal side, while both subsets, upon activation, release macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3alpha/CCL20 apically. These results demonstrate that LECs and BECs constitute stable and specialized EC lineages equipped with the potential to navigate leukocytes and, perhaps also, tumor cells into and out of the tissues.},

We focused on two inflammation-associated cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-{$\beta$}1), and investigated their expression and activity, as well as their relationship to key features of malignancy, in tumour samples from patients with BTC and in cultured BTC cells. METHODS: We employed five BTC cell lines (MzChA-1, gemcitabine-resistant MzChA-1, HuCCT-1, KMCH and CCLP-1) to evaluate IL-6/TGF-{$\beta$}1 expression, tumour cell invasion, EMT and chemoresistance to gemcitabine in the presence or absence of recombinant human (rh) IL-6 and TGF-{$\beta$}1. Possible pathways were evaluated with specific pathway inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA). We also used 20 resected specimens from patients with BTC to verify the results in vitro. RESULTS: IL-6 and TGF-{$\beta$}1 expression was associated with features of malignancy such as EMT and chemoresistance in the four BTC cell lines. Addition of rh IL-6 and TGF-{$\beta$}1 increased endogenous IL-6 and TGF-{$\beta$}1 expression through crosstalk and induced cell invasion, EMT and chemoresistance. Smad4 functioned in this process in a dominant manner, and inhibition by SMAD4 siRNA reduced IL-6 and TGF-{$\beta$}1 expression, blocked invasion, and reversed EMT and chemoresistance in cells exposed to rh IL-6 and TGF-{$\beta$}1 and in gemcitabine-resistant cells. Immunohistochemistry in resected specimens revealed IL6, TGF-{$\beta$}1, N-cadherin and Smad4 staining at the invasion front. CONCLUSION: Crosstalk between IL-6 and TGF-{$\beta$}1 is associated with malignant features, including EMT, and Smad4 works in a dominant manner to promote these features.},

Recent studies showed that YAP stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival. However, the direct transcriptional targets through which YAP exerts its effects are poorly defined. OBJECTIVE: To identify direct YAP targets that mediate its mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects in the heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified direct YAP targets by combining differential gene expression analysis in YAP gain- and loss-of-function with genome-wide identification of YAP-bound loci using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing. This screen identified Pik3cb, encoding p110{$\beta$}, a catalytic subunit of phosphoinositol-3-kinase, as a candidate YAP effector that promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival. YAP and TEA-domain occupied a conserved enhancer within the first intron of Pik3cb, and this enhancer drove YAP-dependent reporter gene expression. Yap gain- and loss-of-function studies indicated that YAP is necessary and sufficient to activate the phosphoinositol-3-kinase-Akt pathway. Like Yap, Pik3cb gain-of-function stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation, and Pik3cb knockdown dampened YAP mitogenic activity. Reciprocally, impaired heart function in Yap loss-of-function was significantly rescued by adeno-associated virus-mediated Pik3cb expression. CONCLUSIONS: Pik3cb is a crucial direct target of YAP, through which the YAP activates phosphoinositol-3-kinase-AKT pathway and regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival.},

Genes required for the normal progression of mitosis represent potential CIN genes and, as such, are important tumour suppressors. The Chk2 kinase and its downstream targets p53 and Brca1 are tumour suppressors that have been functionally linked to the DNA damage response pathway. Here, we report a function of Chk2, independent of p53 and DNA damage, that is required for proper progression of mitosis, and for the maintenance of chromosomal stability in human somatic cells. Depletion of Chk2 or abrogation of its kinase activity causes abnormal mitotic spindle assembly associated with a delay in mitosis, which promotes the generation of lagging chromosomes, chromosome missegregation and CIN, while still allowing survival and growth. Furthermore, we have identified Brca1 as a mitotic target of the Chk2 kinase in the absence of DNA damage. Accordingly, loss of BRCA1 or its Chk2-mediated phosphorylation leads to spindle formation defects and CIN. Thus, the CHK2-BRCA1 tumour suppressor pathway is required for chromosomal stability, which might contribute to their tumour suppressor function.},

The activation of Rac1 leads to a redoubling of mitochondrial motility in murine fibroblasts. Using double-mutants Rac1(G12V, F37L) and Rac1(G12V, Y40H) that are capable to activate different effectors of Rac1, we show that mitochondrial movements are regulated through PAK1 kinase. The involvement of PAK1 kinase is also confirmed by the fact that expression of its auto inhibitory domain (PID) blocks the effect of activated Rac1 on mitochondrial motility. The observed effect of Rac1 and PAK1 kinase on mitochondria depends on phosphorylation of the Ser-55 of vimentin. Besides the effect on motility Rac1 activation also decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) which is detected by {$\sim$}20\% drop of the fluorescence intensity of mitochondria stained with the potential sensitive dye TMRM. One of important consequences of the discovered regulation of MMP by Rac1 and PAK1 is a spatial differentiation of mitochondria in polarized fibroblasts: at the front of the cell they are less energized (by {$\sim$}25\%) than at the rear part.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of human cancer deaths are caused by metastasis. The metastatic dissemination is initiated by the breakdown of epithelial cell homeostasis. During this phenomenon, referred to as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), cells change their genetic and trancriptomic program leading to phenotypic and functional alterations. The challenge of understanding this dynamic process resides in unraveling regulatory networks involving master transcription factors (e.g. SNAI1/2, ZEB1/2 and TWIST1) and microRNAs. Here we investigated microRNAs regulated by SNAI1 and their potential role in the regulatory networks underlying epithelial plasticity. RESULTS: By a large-scale analysis on epithelial plasticity, we highlighted miR-203 and its molecular link with SNAI1 and the miR-200 family, key regulators of epithelial homeostasis. During SNAI1-induced EMT in MCF7 breast cancer cells, miR-203 and miR-200 family members were repressed in a timely correlated manner. Importantly, miR-203 repressed endogenous SNAI1, forming a double negative miR203/SNAI1 feedback loop. We integrated this novel miR203/SNAI1 with the known miR200/ZEB feedback loops to construct an a priori EMT core network. Dynamic simulations revealed stable epithelial and mesenchymal states, and underscored the crucial role of the miR203/SNAI1 feedback loop in state transitions underlying epithelial plasticity. CONCLUSION: By combining computational biology and experimental approaches, we propose a novel EMT core network integrating two fundamental negative feedback loops, miR203/SNAI1 and miR200/ZEB. Altogether our analysis implies that this novel EMT core network could function as a switch controlling epithelial cell plasticity during differentiation and cancer progression.},

  abstract = {Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), a Bcl-2-like antiapoptotic protein, plays a role in cell immortalization and chemoresistance in a number of human malignancies. A peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, Pin1 is involved in many cellular events, such as cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and differentiation through isomerizing prophosphorylated substrates. It has been reported that down-regulation of Pin1 induces apoptosis, and that Erk phosphorylates and up-regulates Mcl-1; however, the underlying mechanisms for the two phenomena are not clear yet. Here, we showed that Pin 1 stabilizes Mcl-1, which is required for Mcl-1 posphorylation by Erk. First, we found expression of Mcl-1 and Pin1 were positively correlated and associated with poor survival in human breast cancer. We then showed that Erk could phosphorylate Mcl-1 at two consensus residues, Thr 92 and 163, which is required for the association of Mcl-1 and Pin1, resulting in stabilization of Mcl-1. Moreover, Pin1 is also required for the up-regulation of Mcl-1 by Erk activation. Based on this newly identified mechanism of Mcl-1 stabilization, two strategies were used to overcome Mcl-1-mediated chemoresistance: inhibiting Erk by Sorafenib, an approved clinical anticancer drug, or knocking down Pin1 by using a SiRNA technique. In conclusion, the current report not only unravels a novel mechanism to link Erk/Pin1 pathway and Mcl-1-mediated chemoresistance but also provides a plausible combination therapy, Taxol (Paclitaxel) plus Sorafenib, which was shown to be effective in killing breast cancer cells.},

  abstract = {The {$\gamma$} subunits of heterotrimeric AMPK complexes contain the binding sites for the regulatory adenine nucleotides AMP, ADP and ATP. We addressed whether complexes containing different {$\gamma$} isoforms display different responses to adenine nucleotides by generating cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged versions of the {$\gamma$}1, {$\gamma$}2 or {$\gamma$}3 isoform. When assayed at a physiological ATP concentration (5 mM), {$\gamma$}1- and {$\gamma$}2-containing complexes were allosterically activated almost 10-fold by AMP, with EC50 values one to two orders of magnitude lower than the ATP concentration. By contrast, {$\gamma$}3 complexes were barely activated by AMP under these conditions, although we did observe some activation at lower ATP concentrations. Despite this, all three complexes were activated, due to increased Thr(172) phosphorylation, when cells were incubated with mitochondrial inhibitors that increase cellular AMP. With {$\gamma$}1 complexes, activation and Thr(172) phosphorylation induced by the upstream kinase LKB1 [liver kinase B1; but not calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK{$\beta$})] in cell-free assays was markedly promoted by AMP and, to a smaller extent and less potently, by ADP. However, effects of AMP or ADP on activation and phosphorylation of the {$\gamma$}2 and {$\gamma$}3 complexes were small or insignificant. Binding of AMP or ADP protected all three {$\gamma$} subunit complexes against inactivation by Thr(172) dephosphorylation; with {$\gamma$}2 complexes, ADP had similar potency to AMP, but with {$\gamma$}1 and {$\gamma$}3 complexes, ADP was less potent than AMP. Thus, AMPK complexes containing different {$\gamma$} subunit isoforms respond differently to changes in AMP, ADP or ATP. These differences may tune the responses of the isoforms to fit their differing physiological roles.},

These cues may include simultaneously occurring attractive soluble growth factor gradients and repulsive effects arising from cell-cell contact, termed contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL). How single cells reconcile potentially conflicting cues remains poorly understood. Here we show that a dynamic crosstalk between epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated chemotaxis and CIL guides metastatic breast cancer cell motility, whereby cells become progressively insensitive to CIL in a chemotactic input-dependent manner. This balance is determined via integration of protrusion-enhancing signalling from EGF gradients and protrusion-suppressing signalling induced by CIL, mediated in part through EphB. Our results further suggest that EphB and EGF signalling inputs control protrusion formation by converging onto regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We propose that this intricate interplay may enhance the spread of loose cell ensembles in pathophysiological conditions such as cancer, and possibly other physiological settings.},

Such disruption contributes to edema formation, the influx of leukocytes, and the entry of potentially neuroactive agents into the perihematomal brain, all of which may contribute to brain injury. A range of factors have been implicated in inducing BBB disruption, including inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines and chemokines), thrombin, hemoglobin breakdown products, oxidative stress, complement, and matrix metalloproteinases. While there is interaction between some of these mediators, it is probable that prevention of ICH-induced BBB disruption will involve blocking multiple pathways or blocking a common end pathway (e.g., by stabilizing tight junction structure). While the effects of ICH on BBB passive permeability have been extensively examined, effects on other 'barrier' properties (metabolic and transport functions) have been less well-studied. However, recent data suggests that ICH can affect transport and that this may help protect the BBB and the brain. Indeed, it is possible in small bleeds that BBB disruption may be beneficial, and it is only in the presence of larger bleeds that disruption has detrimental effects.},

Loss of mitochondrial function can drive age-related declines in the function of many post-mitotic tissues, but little is known about how mitochondrial dysfunction affects mitotic tissues. We show here that several manipulations that compromise mitochondrial function in proliferating human cells induce a senescence growth arrest with a modified SASP that lacks the IL-1-dependent inflammatory arm. Cells that underwent mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS) had lower NAD+/NADH ratios, which caused both the growth arrest and prevented the IL-1-associated SASP through AMPK-mediated p53 activation. Progeroid mice that rapidly accrue mtDNA mutations accumulated senescent cells with a MiDAS SASP in vivo, which suppressed adipogenesis and stimulated keratinocyte differentiation in cell culture. Our data identify a distinct senescence response and provide a mechanism by which mitochondrial dysfunction can drive aging phenotypes.},

  abstract = {The shaping of a multicellular body, and the maintenance and repair of adult tissues require fine-tuning of cell adhesion responses and the transmission of mechanical load between the cell, its neighbors and the underlying extracellular matrix. A growing field of research is focused on how single cells sense mechanical properties of their micro-environment (extracellular matrix, other cells), and on how mechanotransduction pathways affect cell shape, migration, survival as well as differentiation. Within multicellular assemblies, the mechanical load imposed by the physical properties of the environment is transmitted to neighboring cells. Force imbalance at cell-cell contacts induces essential morphogenetic processes such as cell-cell junction remodeling, cell polarization and migration, cell extrusion and cell intercalation. However, how cells respond and adapt to the mechanical properties of neighboring cells, transmit forces, and transform mechanical signals into chemical signals remain open questions. A defining feature of compact tissues is adhesion between cells at the specialized adherens junction (AJ) involving the cadherin super-family of Ca(2+)-dependent cell-cell adhesion proteins (e.g., E-cadherin in epithelia). Cadherins bind to the cytoplasmic protein {$\beta$}-catenin, which in turn binds to the filamentous (F)-actin binding adaptor protein {$\alpha$}-catenin, which can also recruit vinculin, making the mechanical connection between cell-cell adhesion proteins and the contractile actomyosin cytoskeleton. The cadherin-catenin adhesion complex is a key component of the AJ, and contributes to cell assembly stability and dynamic cell movements. It has also emerged as the main route of propagation of forces within epithelial and non-epithelial tissues. Here, we discuss recent molecular studies that point toward force-dependent conformational changes in {$\alpha$}-catenin that regulate protein interactions in the cadherin-catenin adhesion complex, and show that {$\alpha$}-catenin is the core mechanosensor that allows cells to locally sense, transduce and adapt to environmental mechanical constrains.},

  abstract = {Energy deprivation activates the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn induces macroautophagy/autophagy. The mitochondrial-associated ER membrane (MAM) plays a key role in mitochondrial division and autophagy, and the mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2 (mitofusin 2) tethers the MAM, but the mechanism by which AMPK and MFN2 regulate autophagy in response to energy stress remains unclear. Here, we found that energy stress not only triggers mitochondrial fission and autophagy, but more importantly increases the number of MAMs, a process that requires AMPK. Interestingly, under energy stress, considerable amounts of AMPK translocate from cytosol to the MAM and the mitochondrion as mitochondrial fission occurs. Unexpectedly, AMPK interacts directly with MFN2. The autophagic ability of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking MFN2 (mfn2-/-) is significantly attenuated in response to energy stress as compared to wild-type MEFs (WT MEFs), while re-expression of MFN2 in mfn2-/- cells rescues the autophagy defects of these cells. The abundance of MAMs is also greatly reduced in MFN2-deficient cells. Functional experiments show that the oxygen consumption rate and the glycolytic function of cells lacking MFN2 but not MFN1 are obviously attenuated, and MFN2 is important for cell survival under energy stress. In conclusion, our study establishes the molecular link between the energy sensor AMPK and the MAM tether MFN2, and reveals the important role of AMPK and MFN2 in energy stress-induced autophagy and MAM dynamics.Abbreviations: ACTB, actin beta; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; BECN1, beclin 1; CANX, calnexin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; EM, electron microscopy; FL, full-length; KD, kinase dead, KO, knockout; MAb, monoclonal antibody; MAMs, mitochondria-associated membranes; MAP1LC3/LC3B, microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MFN2, mitofusin 2; OPA1, OPA1 mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase; PAb, polyclonal antibody; PtdIns3K, class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; SD, standard deviation; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; TOMM20, translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20; ULK1, unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; WT, wildtype.},

In this study, we have investigated the involvement of p70S6K in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. The DNA-damaging agent cisplatin caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the level of full-length p70S6K in small cell lung cancer H69 and non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells with a concomitant increase in the level of an approximately 45 kDa fragment. The proteolytic cleavage of p70S6K was inhibited by a broad specificity caspase inhibitor but not by the proteosome or calpain inhibitor. Cell-permeable peptide inhibitor and siRNA against caspase-3 inhibited cisplatin-induced proteolytic cleavage of p70S6K. In vitro-translated p70S6K was cleaved by human recombinant caspase-3. Cisplatin failed to induce cleavage of p70S6K in MCF-7 cells that lack functional caspase-3, but ectopic expression of caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells resulted in the cleavage of p70S6K. p70S6K was primarily cleaved at a noncanonical recognition site, Thr-Pro-Val-Asp, after Asp-393. Site-directed mutagenesis of Asp-393 to Ala resulted in protection against cisplatin-mediated apoptosis, whereas introduction of the N-terminal cleaved fragment resulted in potentiation of cisplatin-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that p70S6K is a novel substrate for caspase-3 and that the proteolytic cleavage of p70S6K is important for cisplatin-induced apoptosis.},

  abstract = {Real networks, including biological networks, are known to have the small-world property, characterized by a small ``diameter'', which is defined as the average minimal path length between all pairs of nodes in a network. Because random networks also have short diameters, one may predict that the diameter of a real network should be even shorter than its random expectation, because having shorter diameters potentially increases the network efficiency such as minimizing transition times between metabolic states in the context of metabolic networks. Contrary to this expectation, we here report that the observed diameter is greater than the random expectation in every real network examined, including biological, social, technological, and linguistic networks. Simulations show that a modest enlargement of the diameter beyond its expectation allows a substantial increase of the network modularity, which is present in all real networks examined. Hence, short diameters appear to be sacrificed for high modularities, suggesting a tradeoff between network efficiency and advantages offered by modularity (e.g., multi-functionality, robustness, and/or evolvability).},

A computational search revealed that miR-146b-5p putatively binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of SMAD4, an important member of the transforming growth factor {$\beta$} (TGF-{$\beta$}) signaling pathway. The TGF-{$\beta$} pathway is a negative regulator of thyroid follicular cell growth, and the mechanism by which thyroid cancer cells evade its inhibitory signal remains unclear. We questioned whether the modulation of the TGF-{$\beta$} pathway by miR-146b-5p can contribute to thyroid tumorigenesis. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed the direct binding of miR-146b-5p on the SMAD4 3'UTR. Specific inhibition of miR-146b-5p with a locked nucleic acid-modified anti-miR-146b oligonucleotide significantly increased SMAD4 levels in the human papillary carcinoma cell lines, TPC-1 and BCPAP. Moreover, suppression of miR-146b-5p increased the cellular response to the TGF-{$\beta$} anti-proliferative signal, significantly decreasing the proliferation rate. The overexpression of miR-146b-5p in normal rat follicular PCCL3 cells decreased SMAD4 levels and disrupted TGF-{$\beta$} signal transduction. MiR-146b-5p overexpression in PCCL3 cells also significantly increased cell proliferation in the absence of thyroid-stimulating hormone and conferred resistance to TGF-{$\beta$}-mediated cell-cycle arrest. Additionally, the activation of thyroid most common oncogenes RET/PTC3 and BRAF in PCCL3 cells upregulated miR-146b-5p expression. Our results confirm the oncogenic role of miR-146b-5p in thyroid follicular cells and contribute to knowledge regarding the modulation of TGF-{$\beta$} signal transduction by miRNAs in PTCs.},

Wnt signaling and cadherin-mediated adhesion have been implicated in both processes; clarifying their role will depend on linking them to rearrangements of cellular structure and behavior. beta-Catenin is an essential molecule both in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and in canonical Wnt signaling. Numerous experiments have shown that the loss of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion can promote beta-catenin release and signaling; this is accomplished by proteases, protein kinases and other molecules. Cadherin loss can also signal to several other regulatory pathways. Additionally, many target genes of Wnt signaling influence cadherin adhesion. The most conspicuous of these Wnt target genes encode the transcription factors Twist and Slug, which directly inhibit the E-cadherin gene promoter. Other Wnt/beta-catenin target genes encode metalloproteases or the cell adhesion molecule L1, which favor the degradation of E-cadherin. These factors provide a mechanism whereby cadherin loss and increased Wnt signaling induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition in both carcinomas and development.},

  abstract = {Summary: The earliest stages of intrathymic T-cell development include not only the acquisition of T-cell characteristics but also programmed loss of potentials for B, natural killer, and dendritic cell development. Evidence from genetics and cell-transfer studies suggests an order and some components of the mechanisms involved in loss of these options, but some of the interpretations conflict. The conflicts can be resolved by a view that postulates overlapping windows of developmental opportunity and individual mechanisms regulating progression along each pathway. This view is consistent with molecular evidence for the expression patterns of positive regulators of non-T developmental pathways, SCL, PU.1 and Id2, in early thymocytes. To some extent, overexpression of such regulators redirects thymocyte development in vitro. Specific commitment functions may normally terminate this developmental plasticity. Both PU.1 overexpression and stimulation of ectopically expressed growth factor receptors can perturb T- and myeloid/dendritic-cell divergence, but only in permissive stages. A cell-line system that approximates DN3-stage thymocytes reveals that PU.1 can alter specification even in a homogeneous population. However, the response of the population to PU.1 is sharply discontinuous. These studies show a critical role for regulatory context in restricting plasticity, which is probably maintained by interacting transcription factor networks.},

  abstract = {Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in either of the two tumor suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. Tuberin and hamartin form a complex that inhibits signaling by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a critical nutrient sensor and regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inactivates the tumor suppressor complex and enhances mTOR signaling by means of phosphorylation of tuberin by Akt. Importantly, cellular transformation mediated by phorbol esters and Ras isoforms that poorly activate PI3K promote tumorigenesis in the absence of Akt activation. In this study, we show that phorbol esters and activated Ras also induce the phosphorylation of tuberin and collaborates with the nutrient-sensing pathway to regulate mTOR effectors, such as p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated kinase, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) 1, was found to interact with and phosphorylate tuberin at a regulatory site, Ser-1798, located at the evolutionarily conserved C terminus of tuberin. RSK1 phosphorylation of Ser-1798 inhibits the tumor suppressor function of the tuberin/hamartin complex, resulting in increased mTOR signaling to S6K1. Together, our data unveil a regulatory mechanism by which the Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways converge on the tumor suppressor tuberin to inhibit its function.},

The Drosophila brain features several well-characterized lineages in which a single neuroblast gives rise to multiple neuronal classes in a stereotyped sequence during development. We find that in the intrinsic mushroom body neuron lineage, the numbers for each class are highly plastic, depending on the timing of temporal fate transitions and the rate of neuroblast proliferation. For example, mushroom body neuroblast cycling can continue under starvation conditions, uncoupled from temporal fate transitions that depend on extrinsic cues reflecting organismal growth and development. In contrast, the proliferation rates of antennal lobe lineages are closely associated with organismal development, and their temporal fate changes appear to be cell cycle-dependent, such that the same numbers and types of uniglomerular projection neurons innervate the antennal lobe following various perturbations. We propose that this surprising difference in plasticity for these brain lineages is adaptive, given their respective roles as parallel processors versus discrete carriers of olfactory information.},

Mouse hepatocytes deficient in FoxM1 fail to proliferate and are highly resistant to developing carcinogen-induced liver tumors. We previously developed a transgenic (TG) mouse line in which the ubiquitous Rosa26 promoter was used to drive expression of the human FoxM1b cDNA transgene in all mouse cell types. To investigate the role of FoxM1b in prostate cancer progression, we bred Rosa26-FoxM1b mice with both TRAMP and LADY TG mouse models of prostate cancer. We show that increased expression of FoxM1b accelerated development, proliferation, and growth of prostatic tumors in both TRAMP and LADY double TG mice. Furthermore, development of prostate carcinomas in TRAMP/Rosa26-FoxM1b double TG mice required high levels of FoxM1 protein to overcome sustained expression of the alternative reading frame tumor suppressor, a potent inhibitor of FoxM1 transcriptional activity. Depletion of FoxM1 levels in prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, LNCaP, or DU-145 by small interfering RNA transfection caused significant reduction in proliferation and anchorage-independent growth on soft agar. This phenotype was associated with increased nuclear levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein p27(Kip1) and diminished expression of S-phase promoting cyclin A2 and M-phase promoting cyclin B1 proteins. Finally, we show that elevated levels of FoxM1 protein correlate with high proliferation rates in human prostate adenocarcinomas. Our results suggest that the FoxM1 transcription factor regulates development and proliferation of prostate tumors, and that FoxM1 is a novel target for prostate cancer treatment.},

  abstract = {Due to the myriad interactions between prosurvival and proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, establishing the mechanisms that regulate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway has proven challenging. Mechanistic insights have primarily been gleaned from in vitro studies because genetic approaches in mammals that produce unambiguous data are difficult to design. Here we describe a mutation in mouse and human Bak that specifically disrupts its interaction with the prosurvival protein Bcl-xL Substitution of Glu75 in mBak (hBAK Q77) for leucine does not affect the three-dimensional structure of Bak or killing activity but reduces its affinity for Bcl-xL via loss of a single hydrogen bond. Using this mutant, we investigated the requirement for physical restraint of Bak by Bcl-xL in apoptotic regulation. In vitro, Bak(Q75L) cells were significantly more sensitive to various apoptotic stimuli. In vivo, loss of Bcl-xL binding to Bak led to significant defects in T-cell and blood platelet survival. Thus, we provide the first definitive in vivo evidence that prosurvival proteins maintain cellular viability by interacting with and inhibiting Bak.},

Human XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 are direct inhibitors of at least two members of the caspase family of cell death proteases: caspase-3 and caspase-7. Here we compared the mechanism by which IAPs interfere with activation of caspase-3 and other effector caspases in cytosolic extracts where caspase activation was initiated by caspase-8, a proximal protease activated by ligation of TNF-family receptors, or by cytochrome c, which is released from mitochondria into the cytosol during apoptosis. These studies demonstrate that XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 can prevent the proteolytic processing of pro-caspases -3, -6 and -7 by blocking the cytochrome c-induced activation of pro-caspase-9. In contrast, these IAP family proteins did not prevent caspase-8-induced proteolytic activation of pro-caspase-3; however, they subsequently inhibited active caspase-3 directly, thus blocking downstream apoptotic events such as further activation of caspases. These findings demonstrate that IAPs can suppress different apoptotic pathways by inhibiting distinct caspases and identify pro-caspase-9 as a new target for IAP-mediated inhibition of apoptosis.},

  abstract = {The BH3-only protein Bid is known as a critical mediator of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis following death receptor activation. However, since full-length Bid possesses potent apoptotic activity, the role of a caspase-mediated Bid cleavage is not established in vivo In addition, due to the fact that multiple caspases cleave Bid at the same site in vitro, the identity of the Bid-cleaving caspase during death receptor signaling remains uncertain. Moreover, as Bid maintains its overall structure following its cleavage by caspase 8, it remains unclear how Bid is activated upon cleavage. Here, Bid-deficient (Bid KO) colon cancer cells were generated by gene editing, and were reconstituted with wild-type or mutants of Bid. While the loss of Bid blocked apoptosis following treatment by TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), this blockade was relieved by re-introduction of the wild-type Bid. In contrast, the caspase-resistant mutant Bid(D60E) and a BH3 defective mutant Bid(G94E) failed to restore TRAIL-induced apoptosis. By generating Bid/Bax/Bak-deficient (TKO) cells, we demonstrated that Bid is primarily cleaved by caspase 8, not by effector caspases, to give rise to truncated Bid (tBid) upon TRAIL treatment. Importantly, despite the presence of an intact BH3 domain, a tBid mutant lacking the mitochondrial targeting helices ({$\alpha$}6 and {$\alpha$}7) showed diminished apoptotic activity. Together, these results for the first time establish that cleavage by caspase 8 and the subsequent association with the outer mitochondrial membrane are two critical events that activate Bid during death receptor-mediated apoptosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Apoptosis plays a critical role during neuronal development and disease. Developing sympathetic neurons depend on nerve growth factor (NGF) for survival during the late embryonic and early postnatal period and die by apoptosis in its absence. The proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim increases in level after NGF withdrawal and is required for NGF withdrawal-induced death. The regulation of Bim expression in neurons is complex and this study describes a new mechanism by which an NGF-activated signalling pathway regulates bim gene expression in sympathetic neurons. RESULTS: We report that U0126, an inhibitor of the prosurvival MEK-ERK pathway, increases bim mRNA levels in sympathetic neurons in the presence of NGF. We find that this effect is independent of PI3-K-Akt and JNK-c-Jun signalling and is not mediated by the promoter, first exon or first intron of the bim gene. By performing 3' RACE and microinjection experiments with a new bim-LUC+3'UTR reporter construct, we show that U0126 increases bim expression via the bim 3' UTR. We demonstrate that this effect does not involve a change in bim mRNA stability and by using PD184352, a specific MEK1/2-ERK1/2 inhibitor, we show that this mechanism involves the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of MEK/ERK signalling independently reduces cell survival in NGF-treated sympathetic neurons. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in sympathetic neurons, MEK-ERK signalling negatively regulates bim expression via the 3' UTR and that this regulation is likely to be at the level of transcription. This data provides further insight into the different mechanisms by which survival signalling pathways regulate bim expression in neurons.},

  abstract = {By controlling the YAP1 proto-oncoprotein Hippo signalling plays important roles in cancer-associated processes. Current evidence suggests that the Hippo kinases MST1/2 together with the MOB1 scaffold protein promote the formation of active MOB1/LATS complexes which phosphorylate and thereby inhibit YAP1. However, the regulatory mechanisms of MST1/2-MOB1-LATS signalling are currently underinvestigated. Therefore, we studied LATS2 variants carrying specific modifications that mimic gain or loss of phosphorylation and/or abolish MOB1/LATS2 interactions. We discovered that Ser872 T-loop and Thr1041 hydrophobic motif (HM) phosphorylation of LATS2 is essential for LATS2 activation. MST1/2 phosphorylate LATS2 on Thr1041, but not Ser872, while MOB1 binding to LATS2 supports both phosphorylation events. Significantly, LATS2-PIF, a LATS2 variant containing the PRK2 HM, acts as a hyperactive LATS2 kinase that efficiently phosphorylates YAP1 and inhibits the transcriptional co-activity of YAP1. This inhibitory function of LATS2-PIF is dependent on LATS2 kinase activity, while MOB1/LATS2 and YAP1/LATS2 complex formation is dispensable, suggesting that elevated LATS2 kinase activity can be sufficient to oppose YAP1. Taken together, our characterisation of LATS2 variants uncovers novel insights into the regulation of LATS kinases in Hippo signalling.},

  abstract = {Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental process hijacked by cancer cells to leave the primary tumor site, invade surrounding tissue and establish distant metastases. A hallmark of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin expression, and one major signal for the induction of EMT is transforming growth factor beta (TGF{$\beta$}), which is dysregulated in up to 40\% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aim to identify network perturbations that suppress TGF{$\beta$}-driven EMT, with the goal of suppressing invasive properties of cancer cells. We use a systems-level Boolean dynamic model of EMT to systematically screen individual and combination perturbations (inhibition or constitutive activation of up to four nodes). We use a recently developed network control approach to understand the mechanism through which the combinatorial interventions suppress EMT. We test the results of our in silico analysis using siRNA. Our model predicts that targeting key elements of feedback loops in combination with the SMAD complex is more effective than suppressing the SMAD complex alone. We demonstrate experimentally that expression of a majority of these elements is enriched in mesenchymal relative to epithelial phenotype HCC cell lines. An siRNA screen of the predicted combinations confirms that many targeting strategies suppress TGF{$\beta$}-driven EMT measured by E-cadherin expression and cell migration. Our analysis reveals that some perturbations give rise to hybrid states intermediate to the epithelial and mesenchymal states. Our results indicate that EMT is driven by an interconnected signaling network and many apparently successful single interventions may lead to steady states that are in-between epithelial and mesenchymal states. As these putative hybrid or partial EMT states may retain invasive properties, our results suggest that combinatorial therapies are necessary to fully suppress invasive properties of tumor cells.},

This article is to review and discuss the current knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this particular event. Several transcription factors have been identified as the critical regulators of the formation or maintenance of the two cell lineages. The establishment of TE manifests as the formation of epithelium, and is dependent on many structural and regulatory components that are commonly found and that function in many epithelial tissues. Distinct epithelial features start to emerge at the late 8-cell stage, but the fates of blastomeres are not fixed as TE or ICM until around 32-cell stage. The location of blastomeres at this stage, that is, external or internal of the embryo, in effect defines the commitment towards the TE or ICM lineage, respectively. Some studies implicate the presence of a developmental bias among blastomeres at 2- or 4-cell stage, although it is unlikely to play a decisive role in the establishment of TE and ICM. The unique mode of cell lineage specification in the mouse embryo is further discussed in comparison with the formation of initial cell lineages, namely the three germ layers, in non-mammalian embryos.},

However, how a cluster of cells responds to chemoattractants is not fully understood. Neural crest cells are among the most motile cells in the embryo, and their behavior has been likened to malignant invasion. Here, we show that neural crest cells are collectively attracted toward the chemokine Sdf1. While not involved in initially polarizing cells, Sdf1 directionally stabilizes cell protrusions promoted by cell contact. At this cell contact, N-cadherin inhibits protrusion and Rac1 activity and in turn promotes protrusions and activation of Rac1 at the free edge. These results show a role for N-cadherin during contact inhibition of locomotion, and they reveal a mechanism of chemoattraction likely to function during both embryogenesis and cancer metastasis, whereby attractants such as Sdf1 amplify and stabilize contact-dependent cell polarity, resulting in directional collective migration.},

We find that cells lacking both Bax and Bak, but not cells lacking only one of these components, are completely resistant to tBID-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Moreover, doubly deficient cells are resistant to multiple apoptotic stimuli that act through disruption of mitochondrial function: staurosporine, ultraviolet radiation, growth factor deprivation, etoposide, and the endoplasmic reticulum stress stimuli thapsigargin and tunicamycin. Thus, activation of a "multidomain" proapoptotic member, BAX or BAK, appears to be an essential gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction required for cell death in response to diverse stimuli.},

The factors that regulate these interactions are, at the present time, incompletely understood. Recent studies showing preferences in binding between synthetic Bcl-2 homology domain 3 and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members in vitro have suggested that the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L), but not Bcl-2, restrain proapoptotic Bak from inducing mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. Here we show that Bak protein has a much higher affinity than the 26-amino acid Bak Bcl-2 homology domain 3 for Bcl-2, that some naturally occurring Bcl-2 allelic variants have an affinity for full-length Bak that is only 3-fold lower than that of Mcl-1, and that endogenous levels of these Bcl-2 variants (which are as much as 40-fold more abundant than Mcl-1) restrain part of the Bak in intact lymphoid cells. In addition, we demonstrate that Bcl-2 variants can, depending on their affinity for Bak, substitute for Mcl-1 in protecting cells. Thus, the ability of Bcl-2 to protect cells from activated Bak depends on two important contextual variables, the identity of the Bcl-2 present and the amount expressed.},

  abstract = {Wnt signaling and cadherin-mediated adhesion have been implicated in both processes of embryonic development and the progression of carcinomas. Recent experimental studies revealed that Wnt signaling and cadherin-mediated cell adhesion have close crosstalk with each other. A comprehensive model that investigates the dynamic balance of {$\beta$}-catenins in Wnt signaling and cell adhesion will improve our understanding to embryonic development and carcinomas. We constructed a network model to evaluate the dynamic interplay between adhesion and Wnt signaling. The network is decomposed into three interdependent modules: the cell adhesion, the degradation circle and the transcriptional regulation. In the cell adhesion module, we consider the effect of cadherin's lateral clustering. We found adhesion negatively contributes to Wnt signaling through competition for cytoplasmic {$\beta$}-catenins. In the network of degradation circle, we incorporated features from various existing models. Our simulations reproduced the most recent experimental phenomena with semi-quantitative accuracy. Finally, in the transcriptional regulation module, we developed a function selection strategy to analyze the outcomes of genetic feedback loops in modulating the gene expression of Wnt targets. The specific cellular phenomena such as cadherin switch and Axin oscillation were archived and their biological insights were discussed. Our model provides the theoretical basis of how spatial organization regulates the dynamics of cellular signaling pathways. We suggest that cell adhesion affects Wnt signaling in both negative and positive ways. Cadherins can inhibit Wnt signaling not only in a way as a stoichiometric binding partner of {$\beta$}-catenins that sequesters them from signaling, but also in a way through their clustering to impacts the rate at which {$\beta$}-catenins are involved in the destruction loop. Additionally, cadherin clustering increases the phosphorylation rate of {$\beta$}-catenins and promotes its signaling in nucleus.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional repression mechanisms have emerged as one of the crucial processes for the downregulation of E-cadherin expression during development and tumour progression. Recently, several E-cadherin transcriptional repressors have been characterized (Snail, E12/E47, ZEB-1 and SIP-1) and shown to act through an interaction with proximal E-boxes of the E-cadherin promoter. We have analyzed the participation of another member of the Snail family, Slug, and observed that it also behaves as a repressor of E-cadherin expression. Stable expression of Slug in MDCK cells leads to the full repression of E-cadherin at transcriptional level and triggers a complete epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Slug-induced repression of E-cadherin is mediated by its binding to proximal E-boxes, particularly to the E-pal element of the mouse promoter. Detailed analysis of the binding affinity of different repressors to the E-pal element indicates that Slug binds with lower affinity than Snail and E47 proteins. These results, together with the known expression patterns of these factors in embryonic development and carcinoma cell lines, support the idea that the in vivo action of the different factors in E-cadherin repression can be modulated by their relative concentrations as well as by specific cellular or tumour contexts.},

Because src and ras oncogenes are activated in many human cancers, we investigated their role and downstream signaling pathways in anoikis resistance, using HAG-1 human epithelial cells transfected with v-src or activated H-ras. Consequently, anchorage-dependent mock- or ras-transfected cells underwent anoikis. In contrast, anchorage-independent v-Src-transformed cells did not exhibit such apoptotic features. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a transducer of integrin, was only activated in v-Src-transformed cells. Herbimycin A, an Src kinase inhibitor, reduced tyrosyl phosphorylation of FAK and reversed resistance to anoikis. However, both protein kinase C (PKC) and phophatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase inhibitors failed to induce anoikis. These data suggest that the ability of activated Src to prevent anoikis may be mediated by Src to a downstream signaling pathway involving FAK, but not Ras, PI-3 kinase, or PKC.},

  abstract = {The mTOR signaling complex integrates signals from growth factors and nutrient availability to control cell growth and proliferation, in part through effects on the protein-synthetic machinery. Protein synthesis rates fluctuate throughout the cell cycle but diminish significantly during the G(2)/M transition. The fate of the mTOR complex and its role in coordinating cell growth and proliferation signals with protein synthesis during mitosis remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, which stimulates protein synthesis, is actually hyperactive during mitosis despite decreased protein synthesis and reduced activity of mTORC1 upstream activators. We describe previously unknown G(2)/M-specific phosphorylation of a component of mTORC1, the protein raptor, and demonstrate that mitotic raptor phosphorylation alters mTORC1 function during mitosis. Phosphopeptide mapping and mutational analysis demonstrate that mitotic phosphorylation of raptor facilitates cell cycle transit through G(2)/M. Phosphorylation-deficient mutants of raptor cause cells to delay in G(2)/M, whereas depletion of raptor causes cells to accumulate in G(1). We identify cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1 [cdc2]) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) pathways as two probable mitosis-regulated protein kinase pathways involved in mitosis-specific raptor phosphorylation and altered mTORC1 activity. In addition, mitotic raptor promotes translation by internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) on mRNA during mitosis and is demonstrated to be associated with rapamycin resistance. These data suggest that this pathway may play a role in increased IRES-dependent mRNA translation during mitosis and in rapamycin insensitivity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The target of rapamycin (TOR), in complex with the proteins raptor and LST8 (TOR complex 1), phosphorylates the p70S6K and 4E-BP1 to promote mRNA translation. Genetic evidence establishes that TOR complex activity in vivo requires the small GTPase Rheb, and overexpression of Rheb can rescue TOR from inactivation in vivo by amino-acid withdrawal. The Tuberous Sclerosis heterodimer (TSC1/TSC2) functions as a Rheb GTPase activator and inhibits TOR signaling in vivo. RESULTS: Here, we show that Rheb binds to the TOR complex specifically, independently of its ability to bind TSC2, through separate interactions with the mTOR catalytic domain and with LST8. Rheb binding to the TOR complex in vivo and in vitro does not require Rheb guanyl nucleotide charging but is modulated by GTP and impaired by certain mutations (Ile39Lys) in the switch 1 loop. Nucleotide-deficient Rheb mutants, although capable of binding mTOR in vivo and in vitro, are inhibitory in vivo, and the mTOR polypeptides that associate with nucleotide-deficient Rheb in vivo lack kinase activity in vitro. Reciprocally, mTOR polypeptides bound to Rheb(Gln64Leu), a mutant that is nearly 90\% GTP charged, exhibit substantially higher protein kinase specific activity than mTOR bound to wild-type Rheb. CONCLUSIONS: The TOR complex 1 is a direct target of Rheb-GTP, whose binding enables activation of the TOR kinase.},

We found an unexpectedly intricate function with four plateau levels and four thresholds. This result compares well with a mathematical model of the binding of the regulatory proteins cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and LacI to the lac regulatory region. The model is also used to demonstrate that with few mutations, the same region could encode much purer AND-like or even OR-like functions. This possibility means that the wild-type region is selected to perform an elaborate computation in setting the transcription rate. The present approach can be generally used to map the input functions of other genes.},

Alterations in mural cell density or the stable attachment of mural cells to the endothelium is associated with several human diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, venous malformation, and hereditary stroke. In addition mural cells are implicated in regulating tumor growth and have thus been suggested as potential antiangiogenic targets in tumor therapy. In recent years our knowledge of mural cell function and endothelial-mural cell signaling has increased dramatically, and we now begin to understand the mechanistic basis of the key signaling pathways involved. This is mainly thanks to sophisticated in vivo experiments using a broad repertoire of genetic technologies. In this review, we summarize the five currently best understood signaling pathways implicated in mural cell biology. We discuss PDGFB/PDGFRbeta- dependent pericyte recruitment, as well as the role of angiopoietins and Tie receptors in vascular maturation. In addition, we highlight the effects of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling on adherens junction assembly and vascular stability, as well as the role of TGF-beta-signaling in mural cell differentiation.

To explore the mechanism of repression of cell cycle genes in cervical carcinoma cells following E6/E7 repression, we analyzed regulation of the cdc25A promoter, which contains two consensus E2F binding sites and a consensus E2 binding site. The wild-type E2 protein inhibited expression of a luciferase gene linked to the cdc25A promoter in HT-3 cervical carcinoma cells. Mutation of the distal E2F binding site in the cdc25A promoter abolished E2-induced repression, whereas mutation of the proximal E2F site or the E2 site had no effect. None of these mutations affected the activity of the promoter in the absence of E2 expression. Expression of the E2 protein also led to posttranscriptional increase in the level of E2F4, p105(Rb), and p130 and induced the formation of nuclear E2F4-p130 and E2F4-p105(Rb) complexes. This resulted in marked rearrangement of the protein complexes that formed at the distal E2F site in the cdc25A promoter, including the replacement of free E2F complexes with E2F4-p105(Rb) complexes. These experiments indicated that repression of E2F-responsive promoters following HPV E6/E7 repression was mediated by activation of the Rb tumor suppressor pathway and the assembly of repressing E2F4-Rb DNA binding complexes. Importantly, these experiments revealed that HPV-induced alterations in E2F transcription complexes that occur during cervical carcinogenesis are reversed by repression of HPV E6/E7 expression.},

  abstract = {Microtubules have pivotal roles in fundamental cellular processes and are targets of antitubulin chemotherapeutics. Microtubule-targeted agents such as Taxol and vincristine are prescribed widely for various malignancies, including ovarian and breast adenocarcinomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, leukaemias and lymphomas. These agents arrest cells in mitosis and subsequently induce cell death through poorly defined mechanisms. The strategies that resistant tumour cells use to evade death induced by antitubulin agents are also unclear. Here we show that the pro-survival protein MCL1 (ref. 3) is a crucial regulator of apoptosis triggered by antitubulin chemotherapeutics. During mitotic arrest, MCL1 protein levels decline markedly, through a post-translational mechanism, potentiating cell death. Phosphorylation of MCL1 directs its interaction with the tumour-suppressor protein FBW7, which is the substrate-binding component of a ubiquitin ligase complex. The polyubiquitylation of MCL1 then targets it for proteasomal degradation. The degradation of MCL1 was blocked in patient-derived tumour cells that lacked FBW7 or had loss-of-function mutations in FBW7, conferring resistance to antitubulin agents and promoting chemotherapeutic-induced polyploidy. Additionally, primary tumour samples were enriched for FBW7 inactivation and elevated MCL1 levels, underscoring the prominent roles of these proteins in oncogenesis. Our findings suggest that profiling the FBW7 and MCL1 status of tumours, in terms of protein levels, messenger RNA levels and genetic status, could be useful to predict the response of patients to antitubulin chemotherapeutics.},

Downstream from Chk2, Brca1 promotes monoubiquitination of {$\gamma$}-tubulin to inhibit microtubule nucleation and growth. We found that DNA-PKcs is essential for mitotic Chk2 phosphorylation at Thr68. As in Chk2- and Brca1-deficient cells, loss of DNA-PKcs resulted in chromosome misalignment and lagging during anaphase owing to elevation in microtubule dynamics. Importantly, these mitotic aberrations in DNA-PKcs-defective cells were alleviated by the overexpression of phosphomimetic Chk2 or Brca1 mutant proteins but not their wild-type counterparts. Taken together, these results demonstrate that DNA-PKcs regulates mitotic spindle organization and chromosomal instability via the Chk2-Brca1 signaling pathway.},

Transgenic mice were generated with a fragment of the vWF gene containing 2,182 bp of 5' flanking sequence, the first exon and first intron coupled to the LacZ reporter gene. In multiple independent lines of mice, beta-galactosidase expression was detected within endothelial cells in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. In isogeneic transplantation models, LacZ expression in host-derived auricular blood vessels was specifically induced by the microenvironment of the heart. In in vitro coculture assays, expression of both the transgene and the endogenous vWF gene in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) was upregulated in the presence of cardiac myocytes. In contrast, endothelial cell levels of thrombomodulin protein and mRNA were unchanged by the addition of ventricular myocytes. Moreover, CMEC expression of vWF was not influenced by the addition of 3T3 fibroblasts or mouse hepatocytes. Taken together, the results suggest that the vWF gene is regulated by vascular bed-specific pathways in response to signals derived from the local microenvironment.},

We report the crystal structure of the second BIR domain of XIAP (BIR2) in complex with caspase-3, at a resolution of 2.7 A, revealing the structural basis for inhibition. The inhibitor makes limited contacts through its BIR domain to the surface of the enzyme, and most contacts to caspase-3 originate from the N-terminal extension. This lies across the substrate binding cleft, but in reverse orientation compared to substrate binding. The mechanism of inhibition is due to a steric blockade prohibitive of substrate binding, and is distinct from the mechanism utilized by synthetic substrate analog inhibitors.},

Here, we show that FoxM1 transcriptional activity is kept low during G(1)/S through the action of its N-terminal autoinhibitory domain. We found that cyclin A/cdk complexes are required to phosphorylate and activate FoxM1 during G(2) phase. Deletion of the N-terminal autoinhibitory region of FoxM1 generates a mutant of FoxM1 (DeltaN-FoxM1) that is active throughout the cell cycle and no longer depends on cyclin A for its activation. Mutation of two cyclin A/cdk sites in the C-terminal transactivation domain leads to inactivation of full-length FoxM1 but does not affect the transcriptional activity of the DeltaN-FoxM1 mutant. We show that the intramolecular interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains depends on two RXL/LXL motifs in the C terminus of FoxM1. Mutation of these domains leads to a similar gain of function as deletion of the N-terminal repressor domain. Based on these observations we propose a model in which FoxM1 is kept inactive during the G(1)/S transition through the action of the N-terminal autorepressor domain, while phosphorylation by cyclin A/cdk complexes during G(2) results in relief of inhibition by the N terminus, allowing activation of FoxM1-mediated gene transcription.},

However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch-a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network-in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.},

A double-negative feedback loop involving the miR-200 family and ZEB (zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox) transcription factors has been postulated to control the balance between epithelial and mesenchymal states. Here we demonstrate using the epithelial Madin Darby canine kidney cell line model that, although manipulation of the ZEB/miR-200 balance is able to repeatedly switch cells between epithelial and mesenchymal states, the induction and maintenance of a stable mesenchymal phenotype requires the establishment of autocrine transforming growth factor-{$\beta$} (TGF-{$\beta$}) signaling to drive sustained ZEB expression. Furthermore, we show that prolonged autocrine TGF-{$\beta$} signaling induced reversible DNA methylation of the miR-200 loci with corresponding changes in miR-200 levels. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the existence of an autocrine TGF-{$\beta$}/ZEB/miR-200 signaling network that regulates plasticity between epithelial and mesenchymal states. We find a strong correlation between ZEBs and TGF-{$\beta$} and negative correlations between miR-200 and TGF-{$\beta$} and between miR-200 and ZEBs, in invasive ductal carcinomas, consistent with an autocrine TGF-{$\beta$}/ZEB/miR-200 signaling network being active in breast cancers.},

It has recently been reported that the ephrin-B2 ligand is a molecular marker for the arterial endothelium at the earliest stages of embryonic angiogenesis, while its receptor EphB4 reciprocally marks the venous endothelium. These findings suggested that ephrin-B2 and EphB4 are involved in establishing arterial versus venous identity and perhaps in anastamosing arterial and venous vessels at their junctions. By using a genetically engineered mouse in which the lacZ coding region substitutes and reports for the ephrin-B2 coding region, we demonstrate that ephrin-B2 expression continues to selectively mark arteries during later embryonic development as well as in the adult. However, as development proceeds, we find that ephrin-B2 expression progressively extends from the arterial endothelium to surrounding smooth muscle cells and to pericytes, suggesting that ephrin-B2 may play an important role during formation of the arterial muscle wall. Furthermore, although ephrin-B2 expression patterns vary in different vascular beds, it can extend into capillaries about midway between terminal arterioles and postcapillary venules, challenging the classical conception that capillaries have neither arterial nor venous identity. In adult settings of angiogenesis, as in tumors or in the female reproductive system, the endothelium of a subset of new vessels strongly expresses ephrin-B2, once again contrary to earlier views that such new vessels lack arterial/venous characteristics and derive from postcapillary venules. While earlier studies had focused on a role for ephrin-B2 during the earliest embryonic stages of arterial/venous determination, our current findings using ephrin-B2 as an arterial marker in the adult challenge prevailing views of the arterial/venous identity of quiescent as well as remodeling adult microvessels and also highlight a possible role for ephrin-B2 in the formation of the arterial muscle wall.},

Physiological or pathological conditions can alter this quiescent state through an imbalance of both soluble and insoluble factors that can trigger a cellular phenotypic response. The kind of cellular response depends by many factors but one of the most important is the concentration of soluble cytokines sensed by the target cell. In addition, due to the intrinsic plasticity of many cellular types, every single cell is able, in response to the same stimulus, to rapidly switch phenotype supporting minimal changes of microenviromental cytokines concentration. Wound healing is a typical condition in which epithelial, endothelial as well as mesenchymal cells are firstly subjected to activation of their motility in order to repopulate the damaged region and then they show a strong proliferative response in order to successfully complete the wound repair process. This schema constitute the leitmotif of many other physiological or pathological conditions such as development vasculogenesis/angiogenesis as well as cancer outgrowth and metastasis.Our review focuses on the molecular mechanisms that control the starting and, eventually, the switching of cellular phenotypic outcome in response to changes in the symmetry of the extracellular environment.},

Its three subfamilies have distinct roles: The BH3-only proteins trigger apoptosis by binding via their BH3 domain to prosurvival relatives, while the proapoptotic Bax and Bak have an essential downstream role involving permeabilization of organellar membranes and induction of caspase activation. We have investigated the regulation of Bak and find that, in healthy cells, Bak associates with Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) but surprisingly not Bcl-2, Bcl-w, or A1. These interactions require the Bak BH3 domain, which is also necessary for Bak dimerization and killing activity. When cytotoxic signals activate BH3-only proteins that can engage both Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) (such as Noxa plus Bad), Bak is displaced and induces cell death. Accordingly, the BH3-only protein Noxa could bind to Mcl-1, displace Bak, and promote Mcl-1 degradation, but Bak-mediated cell death also required neutralization of Bcl-x(L) by other BH3-only proteins. The results indicate that Bak is held in check solely by Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) and induces apoptosis only if freed from both. The finding that different prosurvival proteins have selective roles has notable implications for the design of anti-cancer drugs that target the Bcl-2 family.},

Presumably regulation of cell division in the earliest ancestors of eukaryotes was a considerably simpler affair. Nasmyth (1995) recently proposed a mechanism for control of a putative, primordial, eukaryotic cell cycle, based on antagonistic interactions between a cyclin-CDK and the anaphase promoting complex (APC) that labels the cyclin subunit for proteolysis. We recast this idea in mathematical form and show that the model exhibits hysteretic behaviour between alternative steady states: a Gl-like state (APC on, CDK activity low, DNA unreplicated and replication complexes assembled) and an S/M-like state (APC off, CDK activity high, DNA replicated and replication complexes disassembled). In our model, the transition from G1 to S/M ('Start') is driven by cell growth, and the reverse transition ('Finish') is driven by completion of DNA synthesis and proper alignment of chromosomes on the metaphase plate. This simple and effective mechanism for coupling growth and division and for accurately copying and partitioning a genome consisting of numerous chromosomes, each with multiple origins of replication, could represent the core of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Furthermore, we show how other controls could be added to this core and speculate on the reasons why stoichiometric inhibitors and CDK inhibitory phosphorylation might have been appended to the primitive alternation between cyclin accumulation and degradation.},

In this report we explore the effect of phosphorylation of cell division cycle 6 (Cdc6), a DNA replication initiation factor, by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) on the regulation of chromosomal segregation. In mitosis, the phosphorylation of Cdc6 was highly increased, in correlation with the level of Plk1, and conversely, Cdc6 is hypophosphorylated in Plk1-depleted cells, although cyclin A- and cyclin B1-dependent kinases are active. Binding between Cdc6 and Plk1 occurs through the polo-box domain of Plk1, and Cdc6 is phosphorylated by Plk1 on T37. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that Cdc6 and Plk1 colocalize to the central spindle in anaphase. Expression of T37V mutant of Cdc6 (Cdc6-TV) induces binucleated cells and incompletely separated nuclei. Wild-type Cdc6 but not Cdc6-TV binds cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Expression of wild-type Plk1 but not kinase-defective mutant promotes the binding of Cdc6 to Cdk1. Cells expressing wild-type Cdc6 display lower Cdk1 activity and higher separase activity than cells expressing Cdc6-TV. These results suggest that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc6 promotes the interaction of Cdc6 and Cdk1, leading to the attenuation of Cdk1 activity, release of separase, and subsequent anaphase progression.},

Cell density and Hippo signaling have also been reported to block transforming growth factor {$\beta$} (TGF-{$\beta$}) responses, based on the ability of phospho-YAP/TAZ to sequester TGF-{$\beta$}-activated SMAD complexes in the cytoplasm. Herein, we provide evidence that epithelial cell polarization interferes with TGF-{$\beta$} signaling well upstream and independent of cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ. Rather, polarized basolateral presentation of TGF-{$\beta$} receptors I and II deprives apically delivered TGF-{$\beta$} of access to its receptors. Basolateral ligand delivery nonetheless remains entirely effective to induce TGF-{$\beta$} responses. These data demonstrate that cell-type-specific inhibition of TGF-{$\beta$} signaling by cell density is restricted to polarized epithelial cells and reflects the polarized distribution of TGF-{$\beta$} receptors, which thus affects SMAD activation irrespective of Hippo pathway activation.},

Here, we identified p21-regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) by sequencing small RNAs from isogenic p21(+/+) and p21(-/-) cells. Three abundant miRNA clusters, miR-200b-200a-429, miR-200c-141, and miR-183-96-182, were downregulated in p21-deficient cells. Consistent with the known function of the miR-200 family and p21 in inhibition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we observed EMT upon loss of p21 in multiple model systems. To explore a role of the miR-183-96-182 cluster in EMT, we identified its genome-wide targets and found that miR-183 and miR-96 repressed common targets, including SLUG, ZEB1, ITGB1, and KLF4. Reintroduction of miR-200, miR-183, or miR-96 in p21(-/-) cells inhibited EMT, cell migration, and invasion. Conversely, antagonizing miR-200 and miR-183-96-182 cluster miRNAs in p21(+/+) cells increased invasion and elevated the levels of VIM, ZEB1, and SLUG mRNAs. Furthermore, we found that p21 forms a complex with ZEB1 at the miR-183-96-182 cluster promoter to inhibit transcriptional repression of this cluster by ZEB1, suggesting a reciprocal feedback loop.},

The disease represents a range of quantitative and qualitative pathologies of the adhesive glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (VWF). The pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the type 2 qualitative variants of VWF are now well characterized, with most mutations representing missense substitutions influencing VWF multimer structure and interactions with platelet GPIb{$\alpha$} and collagen and with factor VIII. The molecular pathology of type 3 VWD has been similarly well characterized, with an array of different mutation types producing either a null phenotype or the production of VWF that is not secreted. In contrast, the pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for type 1 VWD remain only partially resolved. In the hemostasis laboratory, the measurement of VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo are key components in the diagnostic algorithm for VWD, although the introduction of direct GPIb{$\alpha$}-binding assays may become the functional assay of choice. Molecular genetic testing can provide additional benefit, but its utility is currently limited to type 2 and 3 VWD. The treatment of bleeding in VWD involves the use of desmopressin and plasma-derived VWF concentrates and a variety of adjunctive agents. Finally, a new recombinant VWF concentrate has just completed clinical trial evaluation and has demonstrated excellent hemostatic efficacy and safety.},

However, little is still known about the pathways involved in anoikis resistance of non-epithelial cells such as fibroblasts and sarcomas. Our results show that Src activity contributes to anoikis resistance of human osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells. Src was found to be upregulated in anoikis resistant SAOS cells, and pharmacological inhibition of its activity resulted in the restoration of anoikis sensitivity. A normal pattern of dephosphorylation of FAK was observed upon cell detachment of both anoikis sensitive and resistant SAOS-2 cells, suggesting that FAK activity during anoikis resistance is not essential. The activity of Akt was found to be upregulated in anoikis resistant SAOSar cells and the pharmacological inhibition of PI3-K activity restored sensitivity to anoikis resistant cells, reconfirming the critical role of PI3-K/Akt pathway in cell survival. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Src resulted in a decrease of Akt phosphorylation at Ser473. Altogether, these studies indicated a survival pathway mediated by the Src-dependent activation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway in a manner independent of FAK activity.},

Shared DNA sequence features adapt CGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state. Silencing of CGI promoters is achieved through dense CpG methylation or polycomb recruitment, again using their distinctive DNA sequence composition. CGIs are therefore generically equipped to influence local chromatin structure and simplify regulation of gene activity.},

  abstract = {Contact inhibition of cell growth is essential for embryonic development and maintenance of tissue architecture in adult organisms, and the growth of tumors is characterized by a loss of contact inhibition of proliferation. The recently identified Hippo signaling pathway has been implicated in contact inhibition of proliferation as well as organ size control. The modulation of the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP) by the highly conserved kinase cascade of the Hippo signaling pathway has been intensively studied. However, cell-surface receptors regulating the Hippo signaling pathway in mammals are not well understood. In this study, we show that Hippo signaling pathway components are required for E-cadherin-dependent contact inhibition of proliferation. Knockdown of the Hippo signaling components or overexpression of YAP inhibits the decrease in cell proliferation caused by E-cadherin homophilic binding at the cell surface, independent of other cell-cell interactions. We also demonstrate that the E-cadherin/catenin complex functions as an upstream regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway in mammalian cells. Expression of E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells restores the density-dependent regulation of YAP nuclear exclusion. Knockdown of {$\beta$}-catenin in densely cultured MCF10A cells, which mainly depletes E-cadherin-bound {$\beta$}-catenin, induces a decrease in the phosphorylation of S127 residue of YAP and its nuclear accumulation. Moreover, E-cadherin homophilic binding independent of other cell interactions is sufficient to control the subcellular localization of YAP. Therefore, Our results indicate that, in addition to its role in cell-cell adhesion, E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact directly regulates the Hippo signaling pathway to control cell proliferation.},

In the mammary gland, BM is a continuous deposit that separates epithelial cells from stroma, and its degradation is related with an increased potential for invasion and metastasis. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which epithelial cells are transdifferentiated to one mesenchymal state, and is a normal process during embryonic development, tissue remodeling and wound healing, as well as it has been implicated during cancer progression. In breast cancer cells, native Col IV induces migration and gelatinases secretion. However, the role of native Col IV on the EMT process in human mammary epithelial cells remains to be investigated. In the present study, we demonstrate that native Col IV induces down-regulation of E-cadherin expression, accompanied with an increase of Snail1, Snail2 and Sip1 transcripts. Native Col IV also induces an increase in N-cadherin and vimentin expression, an increase of MMP-2 secretion, the activation of FAK and NF{$\kappa$}B, cell migration and invasion in MCF10A cells. In summary, these findings demonstrate, for the first time, that native Col IV induces an EMT-like process in MCF10A human mammary non-tumorigenic epithelial cells.},

AICD is thought to progress through the activation of the extrinsic Fas/FasL pathway of cell death, leading to cytochrome-C release through caspase-8 and Bid activation. We recently described that, early upon AICD induction, mitochondria undergo structural alterations, which are required to promote cytochrome-C release and execute cell death. Here, we found that such alterations do not depend on the Fas/FasL pathway, which is instead only lately activated to amplify the cell death cascade. Instead, such alterations are primarily dependent on the MAPK proteins JNK1 and ERK1/2, which, in turn, regulate the activity of the pro-fission protein Drp1 and the pro-apoptotic factor Bim. The latter regulates cristae disassembly and cooperate with Drp1 to mediate the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP), leading to cytochrome-C release. Interestingly, we found that Bim is also downregulated in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) cells, this alteration favouring their escape from AICD-mediated control.},

PLK1 phosphorylates early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1) to ensure mitosis entry, whereas Emi2 plays a key role during the meiotic cell cycle. Transcription factor E2F is primarily considered to regulate the G(1)/S transition of the cell cycle but its involvement in the regulation of mitosis has also been recently suggested. A gap still exists between the molecular basis of E2F and mitotic regulation. The present study was designed to characterize the transcriptional regulation of human PLK and Emi genes. Adenoviral overexpression of E2F1 increased PLK1 and PLK3 mRNA levels in A549 cells. A reporter gene assay revealed that the putative promoter regions of PLK1, PLK3, and PLK4 genes were responsive to activators E2F, E2F1-E2F3. We further characterized the putative promoter regions of Emi1 and Emi2 genes, and these could be regulated by activators E2F and E2F1-E2F4, respectively. Finally, PLK1-PLK4, Emi1, and Emi2 mRNA expression levels in human adult, fetal tissues, and several cell lines indicated that each gene has a unique expression pattern but is uniquely expressed in common tissues and cells such as the testes and thymus. Collectively, these results indicate that E2F can integrate G(1)/S and G(2)/M to oscillate the cell cycle by regulating mitotic genes PLK and Emi, leading to determination of the cell fate.},

  abstract = {Cdc25 phosphatases are essential for the activation of mitotic cyclin-Cdks, but the precise roles of the three mammalian isoforms (A, B, and C) are unclear. Using RNA interference to reduce the expression of each Cdc25 isoform in HeLa and HEK293 cells, we observed that Cdc25A and -B are both needed for mitotic entry, whereas Cdc25C alone cannot induce mitosis. We found that the G2 delay caused by small interfering RNA to Cdc25A or -B was accompanied by reduced activities of both cyclin B1-Cdk1 and cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes and a delayed accumulation of cyclin B1 protein. Further, three-dimensional time-lapse microscopy and quantification of Cdk1 phosphorylation versus cyclin B1 levels in individual cells revealed that Cdc25A and -B exert specific functions in the initiation of mitosis: Cdc25A may play a role in chromatin condensation, whereas Cdc25B specifically activates cyclin B1-Cdk1 on centrosomes.},

  abstract = {Many signaling systems show adaptation-the ability to reset themselves after responding to a stimulus. We computationally searched all possible three-node enzyme network topologies to identify those that could perform adaptation. Only two major core topologies emerge as robust solutions: a negative feedback loop with a buffering node and an incoherent feedforward loop with a proportioner node. Minimal circuits containing these topologies are, within proper regions of parameter space, sufficient to achieve adaptation. More complex circuits that robustly perform adaptation all contain at least one of these topologies at their core. This analysis yields a design table highlighting a finite set of adaptive circuits. Despite the diversity of possible biochemical networks, it may be common to find that only a finite set of core topologies can execute a particular function. These design rules provide a framework for functionally classifying complex natural networks and a manual for engineering networks.

  abstract = {Entry into mitosis depends upon activation of the dual-specificity phosphatase Cdc25C, which dephosphorylates and activates the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex. Previous work has shown that the Xenopus polo-like kinase Plx1 can phosphorylate and activate Cdc25C in vitro. In the work presented here, we demonstrate that Plx1 is activated in vivo during oocyte maturation with the same kinetics as Cdc25C. Microinjection of wild-type Plx1 into Xenopus oocytes accelerated the rate of activation of Cdc25C and cyclin B-Cdc2. Conversely, microinjection of either an antibody against Plx1 or kinase-dead Plx1 significantly inhibited the activation of Cdc25C and cyclin B-Cdc2. This effect could be reversed by injection of active Cdc25C, indicating that Plx1 is upstream of Cdc25C. However, injection of Cdc25C, which directly activates cyclin B-Cdc2, also caused activation of Plx1, suggesting that a positive feedback loop exists in the Plx1 activation pathway. Other experiments show that injection of Plx1 antibody into early embryos, which do not require Cdc25C for the activation of cyclin B-Cdc2, resulted in an arrest of cleavage that was associated with monopolar spindles. These results demonstrate that in Xenopus laevis, Plx1 plays important roles both in the activation of Cdc25C at the initiation of mitosis and in spindle assembly at late stages of mitosis.},

This phenotypic change occurs during development and also contributes to pathological processes, such as cancer progression. The molecular mechanisms controlling the switch between the fully epithelial and fully mesenchymal phenotypes and cells that have characteristics of both (partial EMT) are controversial, and multiple theoretical models have been proposed. To test these theoretical models, we systematically measured the changes in the abundance of proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) that represent the core regulators of EMT induced by transforming growth factor-{$\beta$}1 (TGF-{$\beta$}1) in the human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A at the population and single-cell levels. We provide experimental confirmation for a model of cascading switches in phenotypes associated with TGF-{$\beta$}1-induced EMT of MCF10A cells that involves two double-negative feedback loops: one between the transcription factor SNAIL1 and the miR-34 family and another between the transcription factor ZEB1 and the miR-200 family. Furthermore, our data showed that whereas the transition from epithelial to partial EMT was reversible for MCF10A cells, the transition from partial EMT to mesenchymal was mostly irreversible at high concentrations of TGF-{$\beta$}1.},

Here we demonstrate that mammalian CDC6, an essential regulator of initiation of DNA replication, is phosphorylated by CDKs. CDC6 interacts specifically with the active Cyclin A/CDK2 complex in vitro and in vivo, but not with Cyclin E or Cyclin B kinase complexes. The cyclin binding domain of CDC6 was mapped to an N-terminal Cy-motif that is similar to the cyclin binding regions in p21(WAF1/SDI1) and E2F-1. The in vivo phosphorylation of CDC6 was dependent on three N-terminal CDK consensus sites, and the phosphorylation of these sites was shown to regulate the subcellular localization of CDC6. Consistent with this notion, we found that the subcellular localization of CDC6 is cell cycle regulated. In G1, CDC6 is nuclear and it relocalizes to the cytoplasm when Cyclin A/CDK2 is activated. In agreement with CDC6 phosphorylation being specifically mediated by Cyclin A/CDK2, we show that ectopic expression of Cyclin A, but not of Cyclin E, leads to rapid relocalization of CDC6 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Based on our data we suggest that the phosphorylation of CDC6 by Cyclin A/CDK2 is a negative regulatory event that could be implicated in preventing re-replication during S phase and G2.},

The cells can have states with the higher probability ones giving the different cell types. Different cell types correspond to different basins of attractions of the probability landscape. We study how the cells develop from undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells from landscape perspectives. We quantified the Waddington landscape through construction of underlying probability landscape for cell development. We show the developmental process proceeds as moving from undifferentiated to the differentiated basins of attractions. The barrier height of the basins of attractions correlates with the escape time that determines the stability of cell types. We show that the developmental process can be quantitatively described and uncovered by the biological paths on the quantified Waddington landscape from undifferentiated to the differentiated cells. We found the dynamics of the developmental process is controlled by a combination of the gradient and curl force on the landscape. The biological paths often do not follow the steepest descent path on the landscape. The landscape framework also quantifies the possibility of reverse differentiation process such as cell reprogramming from differentiated cells back to the original stem cell. We show that the biological path of reverse differentiation is irreversible and different from the one for differentiation process. We found that the developmental process described by the underlying landscape and the associated biological paths is relatively stable and robust against the influences of environmental perturbations.},

It is well established that many normal cells require integrin-mediated adhesion to enter S phase of the cell cycle. Recent evidence indicates that integrins also regulate cytokinesis. Mechanical properties of the ECM can dictate entry into S phase; however, it is not known whether they also can affect the successful completion of cell division. To address this issue, we modulated substrate compliance using Fibronectin-coated acrylamide-based hydrogels. Soft and hard substrates were generated with approximate elastic moduli of 1600 and 34,000 Pascals (Pa) respectively. Our results indicate that dermal fibroblasts successfully complete cytokinesis on hard substrates, whereas on soft substrates, a significant number fail and become binucleated. Cytokinesis failure occurs at a step following the formation of the intercellular bridge connecting presumptive daughter cells, suggesting a defect in abscission. Like dermal fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells require cell-matrix adhesion for successful cytokinesis. However, in contrast to dermal fibroblasts, they are able to complete cytokinesis on both hard and soft substrates. These results indicate that matrix stiffness regulates the successful completion of cytokinesis, and does so in a cell-type specific manner. To our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate that matrix stiffness can affect cytokinesis. Understanding the cell-type specific contribution of matrix compliance to the regulation of cytokinesis will provide new insights important for development, as well as tissue homeostasis and regeneration.},

These rates are of sufficient magnitude to indicate direct processing in vivo. Differentially processed forms of caspase-3 that accumulate during its activation have similar rates of activation, activities, and specificities. The pattern and rate of caspase-8 induced activation of pro-caspase-3 in cytosolic extracts was the same as in a purified system. Moreover, immunodepletion of a putative intermediary in the pathway to activation, pro-caspase-9, was without consequence. Taken together these data demonstrate that the initiator caspase-8 can directly activate pro-caspase-3 without the requirement for an accelerator. The in vitro data thus help to deconvolute previous in vivo transfection studies which have debated the role of a direct versus indirect transmission of the apoptotic signal generated by ligation of death receptors.},

Reactive oxygen species play a key function during both GF and integrin receptor signalling and are therefore recognised to have a synergistic function with several others transducers for anchorage-dependent growth (ADG). Indeed, redox-regulated proteins include protein tyrosine phosphatases, protein tyrosine kinases, small GTPases, cytoskeleton proteins, as well as several transcription factors. In this review, we focus on the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as key second messengers granting a proper executed mitosis for anchorage-dependent cells through redox regulation of several downstream targets. Besides, redox signals elicited by ECM contact assure a protection from anoikis, a specific apoptosis induced by lack of anchorage. Cancer cells frequently show a deregulation of ROS production and a constitutive oxidative stress has been associated to the achievement of an invasive phenotype. Hence, in cancer cells, the constitutive deregulation of both mitogenic and survival pathways, likely mimicking autocrine/adhesive signals, helps to guide the transformed cells to escape the innate apoptotic response to abolish the signals started by cell/ECM contact, thus sustaining the spreading of anchorage-independent cancer cells and the metastases growth.},

  abstract = {To achieve a coherent evolutionary theory, it is necessary to account for the effects of the environment on the process of development. Phenotypic plasticity is the change in the expressed phenotype of a genotype as a function of the environment. Various measures of plasticity exist, many of which can be united within the framework of a polynomial function. This function is the norm of reaction. For the special case of a linear reaction norm, genetic variation can be partitioned into portions that are independent and dependent on the environment. From this partition two heritability measures are derived which can be used, alternatively, to compare populations or make predictions about the response to selection. Genetically, plasticity is likely due both to differences in allelic expression across environments and to changes in interactions among loci; plasticity is not a function of heterozygosity. Plasticity responds to both artificial and natural selection. The evolution of plasticity is modeled in three ways: optimality models, quantitative genetic models, and gametic models. All models make similar predictions about the conditions that will favor plasticity. In need of further development are the extension of quantitative genetic models, and structured population models; also needed are data on the true shapes of reaction norms and genetic variation and covariation for nonlinear reaction norm parameters and multiple environments.}

  abstract = {Epigenetic inheritance, the transmission of gene expression states from parent to daughter cells, often involves methylation of DNA. In eukaryotes, cytosine methylation is a frequent component of epigenetic mechanisms. Failure to transmit faithfully a methylated or an unmethylated state of cytosine can lead to altered phenotypes in plants and animals. A central unresolved question in epigenetics concerns the mechanisms by which a locus maintains, or changes, its state of cytosine methylation. We developed "hairpin-bisulfite PCR" to analyze these mechanisms. This method reveals the extent of methylation symmetry between the complementary strands of individual DNA molecules. Using hairpin-bisulfite PCR, we determined the fidelity of methylation transmission in the CpG island of the FMR1 gene in human lymphocytes. For the hypermethylated CpG island of this gene, characteristic of inactive-X alleles, we estimate a maintenance methylation efficiency of approximately 0.96 per site per cell division. For de novo methylation efficiency (E(d)), remarkably different estimates were obtained for the hypermethylated CpG island (E(d) = 0.17), compared with the hypomethylated island on the active-X chromosome (E(d) {$<$} 0.01). These results clarify the mechanisms by which the alternative hypomethylated and hypermethylated states of CpG islands are stably maintained through many cell divisions. We also analyzed a region of human L1 transposable elements. These L1 data provide accurate methylation patterns for the complementary strand of each repeat sequence analyzed. Hairpin-bisulfite PCR will be a powerful tool in studying other processes for which genetic or epigenetic information differs on the two complementary strands of DNA.},

We explored the possibility that E2F regulators play a broader role by identifying additional genes bound by E2F in living human cells. A protocol was developed to identify genomic binding sites for DNA-binding factors in mammalian cells that combines immunoprecipitation of cross-linked protein-DNA complexes with DNA microarray analysis. Among approximately 1200 genes expressed during cell cycle entry, we found that the promoters of 127 were bound by the E2F4 transcription factor in primary fibroblasts. A subset of these targets was also bound by E2F1. Most previously identified target genes known to have roles in DNA replication and cell cycle control and represented on the microarray were confirmed by this analysis. We also identified a remarkable cadre of genes with no previous connection to E2F regulation, including genes that encode components of the DNA damage checkpoint and repair pathways, as well as factors involved in chromatin assembly/condensation, chromosome segregation, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Our data indicate that E2F directly links cell cycle progression with the coordinate regulation of genes essential for both the synthesis of DNA as well as its surveillance.},

  abstract = {The Shc family of adaptor proteins is a group of proteins that lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity. Instead, Shc proteins possess various domains that allow them to recruit different signalling molecules. Shc proteins help to transduce an extracellular signal into an intracellular signal, which is then translated into a biological response. The Shc family of adaptor proteins share the same structural topography, CH2-PTB-CH1-SH2, which is more than an isoform of Shc family proteins; this structure, which includes multiple domains, allows for the posttranslational modification of Shc proteins and increases the functional diversity of Shc proteins. The deregulation of Shc proteins has been linked to different disease conditions, including cancer and Alzheimer's, which indicates their key roles in cellular functions. Accordingly, a question might arise as to whether Shc proteins could be targeted therapeutically to correct their disturbance. To answer this question, thorough knowledge must be acquired; herein, we aim to shed light on the Shc family of adaptor proteins to understand their intracellular role in normal and disease states, which later might be applied to connote mechanisms to reverse the disease state.},

Conversely, anti-apoptotic BCL-2-BCL-X(L)-MCL-1 sequesters these 'activator' BH3-only molecules into stable complexes, thus preventing the activation of BAX-BAK. Extensive mutagenesis of BAX-BAK indicates that their activity is not kept in check by BCL-2-BCL-X(L)-MCL-1. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members are differentially inactivated by the remaining 'inactivator' BH3-only molecules including BAD, NOXA, BMF, BIK/BLK and HRK/DP5. BAD displaces tBID, BIM or PUMA from BCL-2-BCL-X(L) to activate BAX-BAK, whereas NOXA specifically antagonizes MCL-1. Coexpression of BAD and NOXA killed wild-type but not Bax, Bak doubly deficient cells or Puma deficient cells with Bim knockdown, indicating that activator BH3-only molecules function downstream of inactivator BH3-only molecules to activate BAX-BAK.

  abstract = {Previously, we reported that adenovirus E1a protein behaves as a tumor suppressor in human cells. It apparently functions by transcriptionally inducing an array of epithelial cell adhesion genes, while repressing other cell-type specific genes, thus producing an epithelial phenotype. Concomitantly, the cells become sensitive to anoikis (apoptosis of epithelial cells detached from extracellular matrix), potentially causing tumor suppression. E1a protein interacts with the nuclear acetylases p300, CBP and P/CAF, and also with the co-repressor protein CtBP. In this study, we have determined the role of these interactions in E1a's phenotypic effects on human tumor cells. The results indicate that E1a's interaction with CtBP activates at least three epithelial cell adhesion gene promoters. The E-cadherin repressor appeared to be the CtBP-interacting protein delta EF1/ZEB, which bound the ras-repressible E-boxes of the E-cadherin promoter. The E1a-CtBP interaction also contributed to anoikis-sensitization. E1a's interactions with the nuclear acetylases conferred epithelial morphologies but did not activate epithelial genes. These latter interactions did not sensitize tumor cells to anoikis but nevertheless conferred tumor suppression. These results implicate CtBP as an antagonist of the epithelial phenotype and anoikis. They also indicate a new but undefined role for nuclear acetylases in maintaining the transformed phenotype.},

Depalmitoylation redistributes farnesylated Ras in all membranes, followed by repalmitoylation and trapping of Ras at the Golgi, from where it is redirected to the PM via the secretory pathway. This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific intracellular compartmentalization. The de/reacylation cycle also initiates Ras activation at the Golgi by transport of PM-localized Ras guanosine triphosphate. Different de/repalmitoylation kinetics account for isoform-specific activation responses to growth factors.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. Here we identify yes-associated protein (YAP) (homolog of drosophila Yki) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) (also known as Wwtr1), transcriptional effectors of the Hippo pathway, as key matrix stiffness-regulated coordinators of fibroblast activation and matrix synthesis. YAP and TAZ are prominently expressed in fibrotic but not healthy lung tissue, with particularly pronounced nuclear expression of TAZ in spindle-shaped fibroblastic cells. In culture, both YAP and TAZ accumulate in the nuclei of fibroblasts grown on pathologically stiff matrices but not physiologically compliant matrices. Knockdown of YAP and TAZ together in vitro attenuates key fibroblast functions, including matrix synthesis, contraction, and proliferation, and does so exclusively on pathologically stiff matrices. Profibrotic effects of YAP and TAZ operate, in part, through their transcriptional target plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which is regulated by matrix stiffness independent of transforming growth factor-{$\beta$} signaling. Immortalized fibroblasts conditionally expressing active YAP or TAZ mutant proteins overcome soft matrix limitations on growth and promote fibrosis when adoptively transferred to the murine lung, demonstrating the ability of fibroblast YAP/TAZ activation to drive a profibrotic response in vivo. Together, these results identify YAP and TAZ as mechanoactivated coordinators of the matrix-driven feedback loop that amplifies and sustains fibrosis.},

TGF-beta is a potent growth inhibitor for most cell types, including epithelial and endothelial cells. The signaling by which TGF-beta controls cell proliferation is not well understood. Many lines of evidence indicate that other signaling pathways, in addition to the prominent TbetaR-I/TbetaR-II/Smad2/3/4 signaling cascade, are required for mediating TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition. Recent studies revealed that TbetaR-V, which is identical to LRP-1, mediates IGF-independent growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 and mediates TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition in concert with TbetaR-I and TbetaR-II. In addition, IRS proteins and a Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatase(s) are involved in the TbetaR-V-mediated growth inhibitory signaling cascade. The TbetaR-V signaling cascade appears to cross-talk with the TbetaR-I/TbetaR-II, insulin receptor (IR), IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), integrin and c-Met signaling cascades. Attenuation or loss of the TbetaR-V signaling cascade may enable carcinoma cells to escape from TGF-beta growth control and may contribute to the aggressiveness and invasiveness of these cells via promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT). Finally, the ratio of TGF-beta binding to TbetaR-II and TbetaR-I is a signal controlling TGF-beta partitioning between two distinct endocytosis pathways and resultant TGF-beta responsiveness. These recent studies have provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-beta-induced cellular growth inhibition, cross-talk between the TbetaR-V and other signaling cascades, the signal that controls TGF-beta responsiveness and the role of TbetaR-V in tumorigenesis.},

  abstract = {In response to DNA damage, cells arrest at specific stages in the cell cycle. This arrest must fulfill at least 3 requirements: it must be activated promptly; it must be sustained as long as damage is present to prevent loss of genomic information; and after the arrest, cells must re-enter into the appropriate cell cycle phase to ensure proper ploidy. Multiple molecular mechanisms capable of arresting the cell cycle have been identified in mammalian cells; however, it is unknown whether each mechanism meets all 3 requirements or whether they act together to confer specific functions to the arrest. To address this question, we integrated mathematical models describing the cell cycle and the DNA damage signaling networks and tested the contributions of each mechanism to cell cycle arrest and re-entry. Predictions from this model were then tested with quantitative experiments to identify the combined action of arrest mechanisms in irradiated cells. We find that different arrest mechanisms serve indispensable roles in the proper cellular response to DNA damage over time: p53-independent cyclin inactivation confers immediate arrest, whereas p53-dependent cyclin downregulation allows this arrest to be sustained. Additionally, p21-mediated inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity is indispensable for preventing improper cell cycle re-entry and endoreduplication. This work shows that in a complex signaling network, seemingly redundant mechanisms, acting in a concerted fashion, can achieve a specific cellular outcome.},

Under physiological conditions EMT is important for embryogenesis, organ development, wound repair and tissue remodeling. However, EMT may also be activated under pathologic conditions, especially in carcinogenesis and metastatic progression. Major signaling pathways involved in EMT include transforming growth factor {$\beta$}(TGF-{$\beta$}), Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog and other signaling pathways. These pathways are related to several transcription factors, including Twist, Smads and zinc finger proteins snail and slug. These interact with each other to provide crosstalk between the relevant signaling pathways.

Snail enhances expressions of a lot of mesenchymal genes including the matrix degradation enzyme matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9) and the EMT transcription factor zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), however, the underlying mechanisms are not clarified. Herein, we investigated how Snail upregulated transcription of ZEB1 and MMP9 induced by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in hepatoma cell HepG2. According to deletion mapping and site directed mutagenesis analysis, the TPA-responsive elements on both MMP9 and ZEB1 promoters locate on a putative EGR1 and SP1 overlapping region coupled with an upstream proposed Snail binding motif TCACA. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed TPA triggered binding of Snail, EGR1 and SP1 on MMP9 and ZEB1 promoters. Double ChIP further indicated TPA induced association of Snail with EGR1 and SP1 on both promoters. Also, electrophoresis mobility shift assay revealed TPA enhanced binding of Snail with a MMP9 promoter fragment. According to shRNA techniques, Snail was essential for gene expression of both ZEB1 and MMP9. In conclusion, Snail transactivates genes involved in tumor progression via direct binding to a specific promoter region.},

To become motile and invasive, embryonic epithelial cells undergo a process of mesenchymal conversion known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Likewise, EMT can be seen in cancer cells as they leave the primary tumor and disseminate to other parts of the body to colonize distant organs and form metastases. In addition, through the reverse process (mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition), both normal and carcinoma cells revert to the epithelial phenotype to, respectively, differentiate into organs or form secondary tumors. The parallels in phenotypic plasticity in normal morphogenesis and cancer highlight the importance of studying the embryo to understand tumor progression and to aid in the design of improved therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {The reprogramming of somatic cells to inducible pluripotent stem cells requires a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. While differentiating ESCs can undergo the reverse process or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), little is known about the role of EMT in ESC differentiation and fate commitment. Here, we show that Snail homolog 1 (Snail) is expressed during ESC differentiation and is capable of inducing EMT on day 2 of ESC differentiation. Induction of EMT by Snail promotes mesoderm commitment while repressing markers of the primitive ectoderm and epiblast. Snail's impact on differentiation can be partly explained through its regulation of a number of ESC-associated microRNAs, including the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family. The miR-200 family is normally expressed in ESCs but is downregulated in a Wnt-dependent manner during EMT. Maintenance of miR-200 expression stalls differentiating ESCs at the epiblast-like stem cell (EpiSC) stage. Consistent with a role for activin in maintaining the EpiSC state, we find that inhibition of activin signaling decreases miR-200 expression and allows EMT to proceed with a bias toward neuroectoderm commitment. Furthermore, miR-200 requires activin to efficiently maintain cells at the epiblast stage. Together, these findings demonstrate that Snail and miR-200 act in opposition to regulate EMT and exit from the EpiSC stage toward induction of germ layer fates. By modulating expression levels of Snail, activin, and miR-200, we are able to control the order in which cells undergo EMT and transition out of the EpiSC state.

  abstract = {Computer models are valuable tools towards an understanding of the cell's biochemical regulatory machinery. Possible levels of description of such models range from modelling the underlying biochemical details to top-down approaches, using tools from the theory of complex networks. The latter, coarse-grained approach is taken where regulatory circuits are classified in graph-theoretical terms, with the elements of the regulatory networks being reduced to simply nodes and links, in order to obtain architectural information about the network. Further, considering dynamics on networks at such an abstract level seems rather unlikely to match dynamical regulatory activity of biological cells. Therefore, it came as a surprise when recently examples of discrete dynamical network models based on very simplistic dynamical elements emerged which in fact do match sequences of regulatory patterns of their biological counterparts. Here I will review such discrete dynamical network models, or Boolean networks, of biological regulatory networks. Further, we will take a look at such models extended with stochastic noise, which allow studying the role of network topology in providing robustness against noise. In the end, we will discuss the interesting question of why at all such simple models can describe aspects of biology despite their simplicity. Finally, prospects of Boolean models in exploratory dynamical models for biological circuits and their mutants will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Cell death is regulated mainly through an evolutionarily conserved form of cell suicide termed apoptosis [1]. Deregulation of apoptosis has been associated with cancer, autoimmune diseases and degenerative disorders. Many cells, particularly those of the hematopoietic system, have a default program of cell death and survival that is dependent on the constant supply of survival signals. The Bcl-2 family, which has both pro- and anti-apoptotic members, plays a critical role in regulating cell survival [2]. One family member, the Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim), contains only a protein-interaction motif known as the BH3 domain, allowing it to bind pro-survival Bcl-2 molecules, neutralizing their function [3]. Disruption of the bim gene results in resistance to apoptosis following cytokine withdrawal in leukocytes, indicating that regulation of the pro-apoptotic activity of Bim is critical for maintenance of the default apoptotic program [4]. Here, we report that withdrawal of cytokine results in upregulation of Bim expression concomitant with induction of the apoptotic program in lymphocytes. Activation of the forkhead transcription factor FKHR-L1, previously implicated in regulation of apoptosis in T lymphocytes [5], was sufficient to induce Bim expression. We propose a mechanism by which cytokines promote lymphocyte survival by inhibition of FKHR-L1, preventing Bim expression.},

These include Emi1, an anaphase-promoting complex (APC) inhibitor whose destruction controls progression through mitosis to G1, and p21(WAF1), a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor activated by DNA damage. We have analyzed the role of p21(WAF1) in G2-M phase checkpoint control and in prevention of polyploidy after DNA damage. After DNA damage, p21(+/+) cells stably arrest in G2, whereas p21(-/-) cells ultimately progress into mitosis. We report that p21 down-regulates Emi1 in cells arrested in G2 by DNA damage. This down-regulation contributes to APC activation and results in the degradation of key mitotic proteins including cyclins A2 and B1 in p21(+/+) cells. Inactivation of APC in irradiated p21(+/+) cells can overcome the G2 arrest. siRNA-mediated Emi1 down-regulation prevents irradiated p21(-/-) cells from entering mitosis, whereas concomitant down-regulation of APC activity counteracts this effect. Our results demonstrate that Emi1 down-regulation and APC activation leads to stable p21-dependent G2 arrest after DNA damage. This is the first demonstration that Emi1 regulation plays a role in the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. Further, our work identifies a new p21-dependent mechanism to maintain G2 arrest after DNA damage.},

Mammalian Polo-like kinase 1, Plk1, may function as a critical link because it is required for chromosome segregation and establishment of the cleavage plane following anaphase onset. A central spindle-localized pool of the RhoGEF Ect2 promotes activation of the small GTPase RhoA, which drives contractile ring assembly at the equatorial cortex. Here, we have investigated how Plk1 promotes the central spindle recruitment of Ect2. Plk1 phosphorylates the noncatalytic N terminus of the RhoGAP HsCyk-4 at the central spindle, creating a phospho-epitope recognized by the BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) repeats of Ect2. Failure to phosphorylate HsCyk-4 blocks Ect2 recruitment to the central spindle and the subsequent induction of furrowing. Microtubules, as well as the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) Prc1, facilitate Plk1 phosphorylation of HsCyk-4. Characterization of a phosphomimetic version of HsCyk-4 indicates that Plk1 promotes Ect2 recruitment through multiple targets. Collectively, our data reveal that formation of the HsCyk-4-Ect2 complex is subject to multiple layers of regulation to ensure that RhoA activation occurs between the segregated sister chromatids during anaphase.},

Apoptotic plasma membrane blebbing is caspase independent during granule exocytosis-mediated cell death, whereas in other instances, this event is a consequence of the cleavage by caspases of the Rho effector, Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK) I. We show here that grB directly cleaves ROCK II, a ROCK family member encoded by a separate gene and closely related to ROCK I, and this causes constitutive kinase activity and bleb formation. For the first time, two proteins of the same family are found to be specifically cleaved by either a caspase or grB, thus defining two independent pathways with similar phenotypic consequences in the cells. During granule-induced cell death, ROCK II cleavage by grB would overcome, for this apoptotic feature, the consequences of deficient caspase activation that may occur in virus-infected or malignant target cells.},

  abstract = {In most carcinomas, invasion of malignant cells into surrounding tissues involves their molecular reprogramming as part of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mutation of the APC gene in most colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) contributes to the nuclear translocation of the oncoprotein {$\beta$}-catenin that upon binding to T-cell and lymphoid enhancer (TCF-LEF) factors triggers an EMT and a proinvasive gene expression profile. A key inducer of EMT is the ZEB1 transcription factor whose expression promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in carcinomas. As inhibitor of the epithelial phenotype, ZEB1 is never present in the epithelium of normal colon or the tumor center of CRCs where {$\beta$}-catenin remains membranous. We show here that ZEB1 is expressed by epithelial cells in intestinal tumors from human patients (familial adenomatous polyposis) and mouse models (APC(Min/+)) with germline mutations of APC that result in nuclear accumulation of {$\beta$}-catenin. However, ZEB1 is not expressed in the epithelium of hereditary forms of CRCs that carry wild-type APC and where {$\beta$}-catenin is excluded from the nucleus (Lynch syndrome). We found that {$\beta$}-catenin/TCF4 binds directly to the ZEB1 promoter and activates its transcription. Knockdown of {$\beta$}-catenin and TCF4 in APC-mutated CRC cells inhibited endogenous ZEB1, whereas forced translocation of {$\beta$}-catenin to the nucleus in APC-wild-type CRC cells induced de novo expression of ZEB1. Upregulation of MT1-MMP and LAMC2 by {$\beta$}-catenin/TCF4 has been linked to invasiveness in CRCs, and we show here that both proteins are activated by ZEB1 coexpressing with it in primary colorectal tumors with mutated APC. These results set ZEB1 as an effector of {$\beta$}-catenin/TCF4 signaling in EMT and tumor progression.},

  abstract = {Fluctuations in rates of gene expression can produce highly erratic time patterns of protein production in individual cells and wide diversity in instantaneous protein concentrations across cell populations. When two independently produced regulatory proteins acting at low cellular concentrations competitively control a switch point in a pathway, stochastic variations in their concentrations can produce probabilistic pathway selection, so that an initially homogeneous cell population partitions into distinct phenotypic subpopulations. Many pathogenic organisms, for example, use this mechanism to randomly switch surface features to evade host responses. This coupling between molecular-level fluctuations and macroscopic phenotype selection is analyzed using the phage lambda lysis-lysogeny decision circuit as a model system. The fraction of infected cells selecting the lysogenic pathway at different phage:cell ratios, predicted using a molecular-level stochastic kinetic model of the genetic regulatory circuit, is consistent with experimental observations. The kinetic model of the decision circuit uses the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, stochastic mechanisms of gene expression, and a statistical-thermodynamic model of promoter regulation. Conventional deterministic kinetics cannot be used to predict statistics of regulatory systems that produce probabilistic outcomes. Rather, a stochastic kinetic analysis must be used to predict statistics of regulatory outcomes for such stochastically regulated systems.},

  abstract = {Transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes - the epithelial to -mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET)\,- are hallmarks of cancer metastasis. While transitioning between the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, cells can also attain a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) (i.e., partial or intermediate EMT) phenotype. Cells in this phenotype have mixed epithelial (e.g., adhesion) and mesenchymal (e.g., migration) properties, thereby allowing them to move collectively as clusters. If these clusters reach the bloodstream intact, they can give rise to clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), as have often been seen experimentally. Here, we review the operating principles of the core regulatory network for EMT/MET that acts as a "three-way" switch giving rise to three distinct phenotypes - E, M and hybrid E/M - and present a theoretical framework that can elucidate the role of many other players in regulating epithelial plasticity. Furthermore, we highlight recent studies on partial EMT and its association with drug resistance and tumor-initiating potential; and discuss how cell-cell communication between cells in a partial EMT phenotype can enable the formation of clusters of CTCs. These clusters can be more apoptosis-resistant and have more tumor-initiating potential than singly moving CTCs with a wholly mesenchymal (complete EMT) phenotype. Also, more such clusters can be formed under inflammatory conditions that are often generated by various therapies. Finally, we discuss the multiple advantages that the partial EMT or hybrid E/M phenotype have as compared to a complete EMT phenotype and argue that these collectively migrating cells are the primary "bad actors" of metastasis.},

Upon vascular injury, the hemostatic system initiates a series of vascular events and activates extravascular receptors that act in concert to seal off the damage. Blood clotting is subsequently attenuated by a plethora of inhibitors that prevent excessive clot formation and eventual thrombosis. The endothelium which resides at the interface between the blood and surrounding tissues, serves an integral role in the hemostatic system. Depending on specific tissue needs and local stresses, endothelial cells are capable of evoking either antithrombotic or prothrombotic events. Healthy endothelial cells express antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents that prevent platelet aggregation and fibrin formation, respectively. In the face of endothelial dysfunction, endothelial cells trigger fibrin formation, as well as platelet adhesion and aggregation. Finally, endothelial cells release pro-fibrinolytic agents that initiate fibrinolysis to degrade the clot. Taken together, a functional endothelium is essential to maintain hemostasis and prevent thrombosis. Thus, a greater understanding into the role of the endothelium can provide new avenues for exploration and novel therapies for the management of thromboembolisms.},

We show that acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to endothelial dysfunction in rat mesenteric arteries. Endothelial-dependent dilation was greatly diminished 24\,h after TBI because of impaired nitric oxide (NO) production. The activity of arginase, which competes with endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) for the common substrate l-arginine, were also significantly increased in arteries, suggesting that arginase-mediated depletion of l-arginine underlies diminished NO production. Consistent with this, substrate restoration by exogenous application of l-arginine or inhibition of arginase recovered endothelial function. Moreover, evidence for increased reactive oxygen species production, a consequence of l-arginine starvation-dependent eNOS uncoupling, was detected in endothelium and plasma. Collectively, our findings demonstrate endothelial dysfunction in a remote vascular bed after TBI, manifesting as impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation, with increased arginase activity, decreased generation of NO, and increased O2- production. We conclude that blood vessels have a ``molecular memory'' of neurotrauma, 24\,h after injury, because of functional changes in vascular endothelial cells; these effects are pertinent to understanding the systemic inflammatory response that occurs after TBI even in the absence of polytrauma.},

However, the regulation of Spry2 during ASC development and how Spry2 modulates TGF{$\beta$} signaling pathway in human LECs have not been characterized. Here, we demonstrate that Spry2 expression level is decreased in anterior capsule LECs of ASC patients. Spry2 negatively regulates TGF{$\beta$}2-induced EMT and migration of LECs through inhibition of Smad2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Also, blockade of Smad2 or ERK1/2 activation suppresses EMT caused by Spry2 downregulation. Collectively, our results for the first time show in human LECs that Spry2 has an inhibitory role in TGF{$\beta$} signaling pathway. Our findings in human lens tissue and epithelial cells suggest that Spry2 may become a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of ASC and capsule opacification.},

In addition, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment increases the levels of Hsp70 and Hsp90 and also enhances the activity of the Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters with these effects being dependent on activation of the STAT-1 transcription factor by IFN-gamma. The effect of IL-6/STAT-3 and IFN-gamma/STAT-1 was mediated via a short region of the Hsp70/Hsp90 promoters, which also mediates the effects of NF-IL6. This region also contains a binding site for the stress-activated transcription factor HSF-1. Furthermore, STAT-1 and HSF-1 interact with one another via a protein-protein interaction and produce a strong activation of transcription. In contrast, STAT-3 and HSF-1 antagonize one another and reduce the activation of both the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Thus, STAT-1 or STAT-3 activation alone or together results in the activation of Hsp promoters. However, STAT-1 or STAT-3 interact differently with HSF-1 to regulate Hsp promoter activity. These results indicate that STATs are able to moduate the Hsp70 and Hsp90 gene promoters and that these transcription factors are likely to play a very important role in Hsp gene activation by nonstressful stimuli and the integration of these responses with the stress response of these genes.},

Recent lines of evidence indicate that p16(INK4a) is also a modulator of gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this novel function are still obscure. Here, we present clear evidence that p16(INK4a) modulates the levels of various microRNAs, with marked positive effect on miR-141 and miR-146b-5p. This effect is mediated through the formation of the p16-CDK4-Sp1 heterocomplex, which binds to Sp1 consensus-binding motifs present in the promoters of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p, and it enables their transcription. In addition, we have shown that p16(INK4a) interacts with Sp1 through the fourth ankyrin repeat, which is crucial for Sp1 binding to the miR-141 and miR-146b-5p promoters and their transcriptional activation. The physiological importance of this association was revealed by the inability of cancer-related p16(INK4a) mutants to interact with Sp1. Moreover, we have shown p16-CDK4-Sp1-dependent up-regulation of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p following UV light-induced DNA damage and the role of these two microRNAs in mediating p16-related induction of apoptosis in response to this genotoxic stress. Together, these results indicate that p16(INK4a) associates with CDK4 not only to inhibit the cell cycle but also to enable the transcription of two important onco-microRNAs, which act as downstream effectors.},

We propose a model in which the balance between promoter activation and transcription influences the variability in messenger RNA levels. To confirm the predictions of our model, we identified both cis- and trans-acting mutations that alter the noise of gene expression.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gene regulatory circuit motif in which two opposing fate-determining transcription factors inhibit each other but activate themselves has been used in mathematical models of binary cell fate decisions in multipotent stem or progenitor cells. This simple circuit can generate multistability and explains the symmetric "poised" precursor state in which both factors are present in the cell at equal amounts as well as the resolution of this indeterminate state as the cell commits to either cell fate characterized by an asymmetric expression pattern of the two factors. This establishes the two alternative stable attractors that represent the two fate options. It has been debated whether cooperativity of molecular interactions is necessary to produce such multistability. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we take a general modeling approach and argue that this question is not relevant. We show that non-linearity can arise in two distinct models in which no explicit interaction between the two factors is assumed and that distinct chemical reaction kinetic formalisms can lead to the same (generic) dynamical system form. Moreover, we describe a novel type of bifurcation that produces a degenerate steady state that can explain the metastable state of indeterminacy prior to cell fate decision-making and is consistent with biological observations. CONCLUSION: The general model presented here thus offers a novel principle for linking regulatory circuits with the state of indeterminacy characteristic of multipotent (stem) cells.},

Recent studies have documented that the Hippo signaling pathway, a downstream cascade of Merlin (a product of NF2), has a key role in organ size control and carcinogenesis by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. We previously reported that MMs show overexpression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional coactivator, the main downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, which results from the inactivation of NF2, LATS2 and/or SAV1 genes (the latter two encoding core components of the mammalian Hippo pathway) or amplification of YAP itself. However, the detailed roles of YAP remain unclear, especially the target genes of YAP that enhance MM cell growth and survival. Here, we demonstrated that YAP-knockdown inhibited cell motility, invasion and anchorage-independent growth as well as cell proliferation of MM cells in vitro. We analyzed genes commonly regulated by YAP in three MM cell lines with constitutive YAP-activation, and found that the major subsets of YAP-upregulating genes encode cell cycle regulators. Among them, YAP directly induced the transcription of CCND1 and FOXM1, in cooperation with TEAD transcription factor.

  abstract = {Cyclin E/Cdk2 is a critical regulator of cell cycle progression from G(1) to S in mammalian cells and has an established role in oncogenesis. Here we examined the role of deregulated cyclin E expression in apoptosis. The levels of p50-cyclin E initially increased, and this was followed by a decrease starting at 8 h after treatment with genotoxic stress agents, such as ionizing radiation. This pattern was mirrored by the cyclin E-Cdk2-associated kinase activity and a time-dependent expression of a novel p18-cyclin E. p18-cyclin E was induced during apoptosis triggered by multiple genotoxic stress agents in all hematopoietic tumor cell lines we have examined. The p18-cyclin E expression was prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression and by the general caspase and specific caspase 3 pharmacologic inhibitors zVAD-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) and N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD-CHO), indicating that it was linked to apoptosis. A p18-cyclin E(276-395) (where cyclin E(276-395) is the cyclin E fragment containing residues 276 to 395) was reconstituted in vitro, with mutagenesis experiments, indicating that the caspase-dependent cleavage was at amino acid residues 272 to 275. Immunoprecipitation analyses of the ectopically expressed cyclin E(1-275), cyclin E(276-395) deletion mutants, and native p50-cyclin E demonstrated that caspase-mediated cyclin E cleavage eliminated interaction with Cdk2 and therefore inactivated the associated kinase activity. Overexpression of cyclin E(276-395), but not of several other cyclin E mutants, specifically induced phosphatidylserine exposure and caspase activation in a dose-dependent manner, which were inhibited in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells or in the presence of zVAD-fmk. Apoptosis and generation of p18-cyclin E were significantly inhibited by overexpressing the cleavage-resistant cyclin E mutant, indicating a functional role for caspase-dependent proteolysis of cyclin E for apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells.},

Ser(10) is the major phosphorylation site of p27(Kip1), and phosphorylation of this residue affects protein stability. Phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) on Ser(10) has now been shown to be required for the binding of CRM1, a carrier protein for nuclear export. The p27(Kip1) protein was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm at the G(0)-G(1) transition of the cell cycle, and this export was inhibited by leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export. The nuclear export and subsequent degradation of p27(Kip1) at the G(0)-G(1) transition were observed in cells lacking Skp2, the F-box protein component of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, indicating that these early events are independent of Skp2-mediated proteolysis. Substitution of Ser(10) with Ala (S10A) markedly reduced the extent of p27(Kip1) export, whereas substitution of Ser(10) with Asp (S10D) or Glu (S10E) promoted export. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that CRM1 preferentially interacted with S10D and S10E but not with S10A, suggesting that the phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) on Ser(10) is required for its binding to CRM1 and for its subsequent nuclear export.},

Fibrogenesis and tumor progression are regulated in part through the activation and activity of myofibroblasts. Increasing evidence links myofibroblasts found within fibrotic lesions and the tumor microenvironment to a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a phenotypic change in which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics. EMT can be stimulated by soluble signals, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-{$\beta$}, and recent studies have identified a role for mechanical cues in directing EMT. In this review, we describe the role that EMT plays in fibrogenesis and in the progression of cancer, with particular emphasis placed on biophysical signaling mechanisms that control the EMT program. We further describe specific TGF{$\beta$}-induced intracellular signaling cascades that are affected by cell- and tissue-level mechanics. Finally, we highlight the implications of mechanical induction of EMT on the development of treatments and targeted intervention strategies for fibrosis and cancer.},

The active cyclin-B1-Cdk1 complex first appears at the centrosome, suggesting that the centrosome may facilitate the activation of mitotic regulators required for the commitment of cells to mitosis. However, the signalling pathways involved in controlling the initial activation of Cdk1 at the centrosome remain largely unknown. Here, we show that human Chk1 kinase localizes to interphase, but not mitotic, centrosomes. Chemical inhibition of Chk1 resulted in premature centrosome separation and activation of centrosome-associated Cdk1. Forced immobilization of kinase-inactive Chk1 to centrosomes also resulted in premature Cdk1 activation. Conversely, under such conditions wild-type Chk1 impaired activation of centrosome-associated Cdk1, thereby resulting in DNA endoreplication and centrosome amplification. Activation of centrosomal Cdk1 in late prophase seemed to be mediated by cytoplasmic Cdc25B, whose activity is controlled by centrosome-associated Chk1. These results suggest that centrosome-associated Chk1 shields centrosomal Cdk1 from unscheduled activation by cytoplasmic Cdc25B, thereby contributing to proper timing of the initial steps of cell division, including mitotic spindle formation.},

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent human malignancies, and individuals who are chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers have a greater than 100-fold increased relative risk of developing HCC. Here we report a mechanism by which HBV-X protein (HBX) upregulates beta-catenin. Erk, which is activated by HBX, associates with GSK-3beta through a docking motif ((291)FKFP) of GSK-3beta and phosphorylates GSK-3beta at the (43)Thr residue, which primes GSK-3beta for its subsequent phosphorylation at Ser9 by p90RSK, resulting in inactivation of GSK-3beta and upregulation of beta-catenin. This pathway is a general signal, as it was also observed in cell lines in which Erk-primed inactivation of GSK-3beta was regulated by IGF-1, TGF-beta, and receptor tyrosine kinase HER2, and is further supported by immunohistochemical staining in different human tumors, including cancers of the liver, breast, kidney, and stomach.},

All these agents impose a prolonged mitotic arrest in cancer cells that relies on sustained activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and may lead to subsequent cell death by incompletely understood molecular events. We have investigated the role played by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in the fate of mitotically arrested mammary tumor cells treated with paclitaxel, or depleted in Cdc20, the activator of the anaphase promoting complex. Under these conditions, a weak and delayed mitotic cell death occurs that is caspase- and Bax/Bak-independent. Moreover, BH3 profiling assays indicate that viable cells during mitotic arrest are primed to die by apoptosis and that Bcl-xL is required to maintain mitochondrial integrity. Consistently, Bcl-xL depletion, or treatment with its inhibitor ABT-737 (but not with the specific Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199), during mitotic arrest converts cell response to antimitotics to efficient caspase and Bax-dependent apoptosis. Apoptotic priming under conditions of mitotic arrest relies, at least in part, on the phosphorylation on serine 62 of Bcl-xL, which modulates its interaction with Bax and its sensitivity to ABT-737. The phospho-mimetic S62D-Bcl-xL mutant is indeed less efficient than the corresponding phospho-deficient S62A-Bcl-xL mutant in sequestrating Bax and in protecting cancer cells from mitotic cell death or yeast cells from Bax-induced growth inhibition. Our results provide a rationale for combining Bcl-xL targeting to antimitotic agents to improve clinical efficacy of antimitotic strategy in cancer therapy.},

Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Physiological and pathological conditions that affect the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) provoke ER stress and trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR aims to either restore the balance between newly synthesized and misfolded proteins or if the damage is severe, to trigger cell death. However, the molecular events underlying the switch between repair and cell death are not well understood. The ER-resident chaperone BiP governs the UPR by sensing misfolded proteins and thereby releasing and activating the three mediators of the UPR: PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. PERK promotes G2 cell cycle arrest and cellular repair by inducing the alternative translated p53 isoform p53{$\Delta$}N40 (p53/47), which activates 14-3-3{$\sigma$} via suppression of p21CDKN1A. Here we show that prolonged ER stress promotes apoptosis via a p53-dependent inhibition of BiP expression. This leads to the release of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only BIK from BiP and activation of apoptosis. Suppression of bip mRNA translation is mediated via the specific binding of p53 to the first 346-nt of the bip mRNA and via a p53 trans-suppression domain located within the first seven N-terminal amino acids of p53{$\Delta$}N40. This work shows how p53 targets BiP to promote apoptosis during severe ER stress and further illustrates how regulation of mRNA translation has a key role in p53-mediated regulation of gene expression during the UPR.},

Indeed, senescent and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) express factors that promote tumorigenesis that are collectively referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Despite their importance in tumorigenesis, the mechanisms that control TME-derived factor expression remain poorly understood. Here, we address a key unanswered question: how the SASP is sustained in senescent fibroblasts and CAFs. We find that the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38MAPK) controls AUF1 occupancy on SASP mRNAs and thus controls their stability. The importance of this regulatory mechanism is underscored by our findings that stromal-specific p38MAPK inhibition abrogates the tumor-promoting activities of CAFs and senescent fibroblasts. Our data suggest that targeting SASP mRNA stability through inhibition of p38MAPK will significantly aid the development of clinical strategies to target the TME. SIGNIFICANCE: The TME plays a key role in tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that p38MAPK governs a posttranscriptional mechanism that sustains the protumorigenic SASP. Inhibition of p38MAPK abrogates the tumor-promoting activities of CAFs and senescent fibroblasts. Thus, p38MAPK is a TME-specific Achilles' heel that may be exploited as a new therapeutic target.},

Numerous in vitro and tumor-profiling studies point to the miR-200-Zeb1 axis as crucial in regulating this process, yet in vivo studies involving its regulation within a physiological context are lacking. Here, we show that miR-200 ablation in the Rip-Tag2 insulinoma mouse model induces beta-cell dedifferentiation, initiates an EMT expression program, and promotes tumor invasion. Strikingly, disrupting the miR-200 sites of the endogenous Zeb1 locus causes a similar phenotype. Reexpressing members of the miR-200 superfamily in vitro reveals that the miR-200c family and not the co-expressed and closely related miR-141 family is responsible for regulation of Zeb1 and EMT. Our results thus show that disrupting the in vivo regulation of Zeb1 by miR-200c is sufficient to drive EMT, thus highlighting the importance of this axis in tumor progression and invasion and its potential as a therapeutic target.},

  abstract = {Chemical and physical properties of the environment control cell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis in the long term. However, to be able to move and migrate through a complex three-dimensional environment, cells must quickly adapt in the short term to the physical properties of their surroundings. Interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) occur through focal adhesions or hemidesmosomes via the engagement of integrins with fibrillar ECM proteins. Cells also interact with their neighbors, and this involves various types of intercellular adhesive structures such as tight junctions, cadherin-based adherens junctions, and desmosomes. Mechanobiology studies have shown that cell\textendash ECM and cell\textendash cell adhesions participate in mechanosensing to transduce mechanical cues into biochemical signals and conversely are responsible for the transmission of intracellular forces to the extracellular environment. As they migrate, cells use these adhesive structures to probe their surroundings, adapt their mechanical properties, and exert the appropriate forces required for their movements. The focus of this review is to give an overview of recent developments showing the bidirectional relationship between the physical properties of the environment and the cell mechanical responses during single and collective cell migration.},

We determined previously that membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein discs large homolog 5 (DLG5) functions in cell polarity and regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation via undefined mechanisms. We report here that DLG5 functions as an evolutionarily conserved scaffold and negative regulator of Hippo signaling, which controls organ size through the modulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Affinity purification/mass spectrometry revealed a critical role of DLG5 in the formation of protein assemblies containing core Hippo kinases mammalian ste20 homologs 1/2 (MST1/2) and Par-1 polarity proteins microtubule affinity-regulating kinases 1/2/3 (MARK1/2/3). Consistent with this finding, Hippo signaling is markedly hyperactive in mammalian               Dlg5               -/-               tissues and cells in vivo and ex vivo and in               Drosophila               upon               dlg5               knockdown.

Mechanistically, we show that DLG5 inhibits the association between MST1/2 and large tumor suppressor homologs 1/2 (LATS1/2), uses its scaffolding function to link MST1/2 with MARK3, and inhibits MST1/2 kinase activity. These data reveal a direct connection between cell polarity proteins and Hippo, which is essential for proper development of multicellular organisms.},

No actin stress fibers are seen in fibroblasts on soft surfaces, and the appearance of stress fibers is abrupt and complete at a stiffness range coincident with that at which they spread. Upregulation of alpha5 integrin also occurs in the same stiffness range, but exogenous expression of alpha5 integrin is not sufficient to cause cell spreading on soft surfaces. Neutrophils, in contrast, show no dependence of either resting shape or ability to spread after activation when cultured on surfaces as soft as 2 Pa compared to glass. The shape and cytoskeletal differences evident in single cells on soft compared to hard substrates are eliminated when fibroblasts or endothelial cells make cell-cell contact.

  abstract = {Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), a mitochondrial protein, was shown to have antiproliferative properties when overexpressed. In this article, we show that activation of resting human peripheral blood T cells caused downregulation of Mfn2 levels. This downregulation of Mfn2 was blocked by different inhibitors (mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and Akt inhibitor A443654), producing cells that were arrested in the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the activation-induced downregulation of Mfn2 preceded the entry of the cells into the cell cycle, suggesting that Mfn2 downregulation is a prerequisite for activated T cell entry into the cell cycle. Accordingly, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Mfn2 resulted in increased T cell proliferation. Overexpression of constitutively active AKT resulted in the downregulation of Mfn2, which can be blocked by a proteasome inhibitor. Akt-mediated downregulation of Mfn2 was via the mTORC1 pathway because this downregulation was blocked by rapamycin, and overexpression of wild-type, but not kinase-dead mTOR, caused Mfn2 downregulation. Our data suggested that activation-induced reactive oxygen species production plays an important role in the downregulation of Mfn2. Collectively, our data suggest that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway plays an important role in activation-induced downregulation of Mfn2 and subsequent proliferation of resting human T cells.},

Cdc20 (fizzy (fzy)) or p55CDC, and Cdh1 (Hct1, srw1 or fizzy-related 1 (fzr1)) encode two adaptor proteins that bring substrates to the APC. Both APC-Cdc20 and APC-Cdh1 have been implicated in the control of mitosis through mediating ubiquitination of mitotic regulators, such as cyclin B1 and securin. However, the importance of Cdh1 function in vivo and whether its function is redundant with that of Cdc20 are unclear. Here we have analysed mice lacking Cdh1. We show that Cdh1 is essential for placental development and that its deficiency causes early lethality. Cdhl-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) entered replicative senescence prematurely because of stabilization of Ets2 and subsequent activation of p6(Ink4a) expression. These results have uncovered an unexpected role of the APC in maintaining replicative lifespan of MEFs. Further, Cdh1 heterozygous mice show defects in late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the hippocampus and are deficient in contextual fear-conditioning, suggesting that Cdh1 has a role in learning and memory.},

  abstract = {Tumor progression to metastasis is a complex, sequential process that requires proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, motility and invasion to colonize at distant sites. The acquisition of these features implies a phenotypic plasticity by tumor cells that must adapt to different conditions by modulating several signaling pathways (1) during the journey to the final site of metastasis. Several transcription factors and microRNA play a role in tumor progression, but less is known about the control of their expression during this process. Here, we demonstrate by ectopic expression and gene silencing that the proto-oncogene c-Myb activates the expression of the 5 members of miR200 family (miR200b, miR200a, miR429, miR200c and miR141) that are involved in the control of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in many types of cancers. Transcriptional activation of miR200 by c-Myb occurs through binding to myb binding sites located in the promoter regions of miR200 genes on human chromosomes 1 and 12. Furthermore, when c-Myb and the transcriptional repressor ZEB1 are co-expressed, as at the onset EMT, the repression by ZEB1 prevails over the activation by c-Myb, and the expression of miR200 is inhibited. We also demonstrate that during EMT induced by TGF-{$\beta$}, the promoters of miR200 genes are methylated, and their transcription is repressed regardless of the presence of repressors such as ZEB1 and activators such as c-Myb. Finally, we find a correlation between the expression of c-Myb and that of four out of 5 miR200 in a data set of 207 breast cancer patients.},

At least nine ideas exist regarding how plasticity may be costly or limited, but these have rarely been discussed together. The most commonly discussed cost is that of maintaining the sensory and regulatory machinery needed for plasticity, which may require energy and material expenses. A frequently considered limit to the benefit of plasticity is that the environmental cues guiding plastic development can be unreliable. Such costs and limits have recently been included in theoretical models and, perhaps more importantly, relevant empirical studies now have emerged. Despite the current interest in costs and limits of plasticity, several lines of reasoning suggest that they might be difficult to demonstrate.},

Cancer cells acquire the ability to proliferate anchorage-independently, a characteristic feature of malignantly transformed cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this escape of the normal control mechanisms remain unclear. The current study aimed to identify adhesion-induced reactions regulating the cytokinesis of non-transformed human fibroblasts.The adhesion-dependent control of cytokinesis was found to occur at a late stage close to the abscission, during which the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) severs the thin intercellular bridge connecting two nascent daughter cells. CEP55, a key protein involved in the abscission process, was localized at the midbody in both adherent and non-adherent fibroblasts, but it was unable to efficiently recruit ALIX, TSG101, and consequently the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP4B was missing in the non-adherent cells. PLK1, a kinase that prevents premature recruitment of CEP55 to the midbody, disappeared from this site more rapidly in the non-adherent cells. A FAK-Src signaling pathway downstream of integrin-mediated cell adhesion was found to decelerate both PLK1 degradation and CEP55 accumulation at the midbody. These data identify the regulation of PLK1 and CEP55 as steps where integrins exert control over the cytokinetic abscission.},

However, the biochemical function of merlin and the effector pathways critical for the pathogenesis of malignant mesothelioma and other               NF2               -related malignancies are not known. We report that integrin-specific signaling promotes activation of mTORC1 and cap-dependent mRNA translation. Depletion of merlin rescues mTORC1 signaling in cells deprived of anchorage to a permissive extracellular matrix, suggesting that integrin signaling controls mTORC1 through inactivation of merlin. This signaling pathway controls translation of the cyclin D1 mRNA and, thereby, cell cycle progression. In addition, it promotes cell survival. Analysis of a panel of malignant mesothelioma cell lines reveals a strong correlation between loss of merlin and activation of mTORC1. Merlin-negative lines are sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effect of rapamycin, and the expression of recombinant merlin renders them partially resistant to rapamycin. Conversely, depletion of merlin restores rapamycin sensitivity in merlin-positive lines. These results indicate that integrin-mediated adhesion promotes mTORC1 signaling through the inactivation of merlin. Furthermore, they reveal that merlin-negative mesotheliomas display unregulated mTORC1 signaling and are sensitive to rapamycin, thus providing a preclinical rationale for prospective, biomarker-driven clinical studies of mTORC1 inhibitors in these tumors.},

The protein level, activity, and localization of Plk1 change during the cell cycle, and its proper subcellular localization is thought to be crucial for its function. Although localization of Plk1 to the centrosome has been established, nuclear localization or nucleocytoplasmic translocation of Plk1 has not been fully addressed. Here we show that Plk1 accumulates in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in addition to its localization to the centrosome during S and G(2) phases. Our results identify a conserved region in the kinase domain of Plk1 (residues 134-146) as a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence that regulates nuclear translocation of Plk1. The identified NLS is necessary and sufficient for directing nuclear localization of Plk1. This bipartite NLS has an unusually short spacer sequence between two clusters of basic amino acids but is sensitive to RanQ69L, a dominant negative form of Ran, similar to ordinary bipartite NLS. Remarkably, the expression of an NLS-disrupted mutant of Plk1 during S phase was found to arrest the cells in G(2) phase. These results suggest that the bipartite NLS-dependent nuclear localization of Plk1 before mitosis is important for ensuring normal cell cycle progression.},

In endothelial cells (EC), the transcription factor NF-{$\kappa$}B is important in the switch from quiescence to activation, and is tightly controlled to avoid excessive inflammation and organ damage. Here we describe a novel mechanism that controls the activation of NF-{$\kappa$}B in EC. The transcription factor Erg, the most highly expressed ETS member in resting EC, controls quiescence by repressing proinflammatory gene expression. Focusing on intercellular adhesion molecule 1(ICAM)-1 as a model, we identify two ETS binding sites (EBS -118 and -181) within the ICAM-1 promoter required for Erg-mediated repression. We show that Erg binds to both EBS -118 and EBS -181, the latter located within the NF-{$\kappa$}B binding site. Interestingly, inhibition of Erg expression in quiescent EC results in increased NF-{$\kappa$}B-dependent ICAM-1 expression, indicating that Erg represses basal NF-{$\kappa$}B activity. Erg prevents NF-{$\kappa$}B p65 from binding to the ICAM-1 promoter, suggesting a direct mechanism of interference. Gene set enrichment analysis of transcriptome profiles of Erg and NF-{$\kappa$}B-dependent genes, together with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies, reveals that this mechanism is common to other proinflammatory genes, including cIAP-2 and IL-8. These results identify a role for Erg as a gatekeeper controlling vascular inflammation, thus providing an important barrier to protect against inappropriate endothelial activation.},

Stimulation of the proximal tubular cell line HK-2 cells by TGF-beta 1 led to loss of cell-cell contact and disassembly of both adherens and tight junctional complexes. Adherens junction disassembly was associated with reduction of both Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble E-cadherin, and an increase in detergent-soluble beta-catenin. Under these conditions, immunoprecipitation and Western analysis demonstrated decreased association of beta-catenin, both with E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and the cell cytoskeleton. Confocal microscopy after immunostaining, showed decreased intensity of peripheral E-cadherin staining, and redistribution of beta-catenin expression to a perinuclear location. Tight junction disassembly was manifest by a reduction in the expression of Triton-soluble occludin and ZO-1 by Western analysis and their disassociation manifested by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. Loss of cell-cell contact and disassembly of adherens junctions were seen after addition of TGF-beta 1 to the basolateral aspect of the cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated co-localization of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and TGF-beta 1 RII in unstimulated cells. After TGF-beta 1 stimulation, the TGF-beta 1 RII no longer associated with either E-cadherin or beta-catenin. Dissociation of the adherens junction protein from the TGF-beta 1 receptor was associated with increased beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased threonine phosphorylation. Furthermore after receptor ligand binding, beta-catenin became associated with the TGF-beta 1-signaling molecules Smad3 and Smad4.},

First, signaling gradients establish initial conditions that polarize the tissue, but there is no strict correspondence between specific morphogen thresholds and boundary positions. Second, gradients initiate transcriptional networks that integrate broadly distributed activators and localized repressors to generate patterns of gene expression. Third, the correct positioning of boundaries depends on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the transcriptional networks. These similarities reveal design principles that are likely to be broadly applicable to morphogen-patterned tissues.},

  abstract = {Insulin stimulates protein synthesis and cell growth by activation of the protein kinases Akt (also known as protein kinase B, PKB) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). It was reported that Akt activates mTOR by phosphorylation and inhibition of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2). However, in recent studies the physiological requirement of Akt phosphorylation of TSC2 for mTOR activation has been questioned. Here, we identify PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt/PKB substrate 40 kDa) as a novel mTOR binding partner that mediates Akt signals to mTOR. PRAS40 binds the mTOR kinase domain and its interaction with mTOR is induced under conditions that inhibit mTOR signalling, such as nutrient or serum deprivation or mitochondrial metabolic inhibition. Binding of PRAS40 inhibits mTOR activity and suppresses constitutive activation of mTOR in cells lacking TSC2. PRAS40 silencing inactivates insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Akt, and uncouples the response of mTOR to Akt signals. Furthermore, PRAS40 phosphorylation by Akt and association with 14-3-3, a cytosolic anchor protein, are crucial for insulin to stimulate mTOR. These findings identify PRAS40 as an important regulator of insulin sensitivity of the Akt-mTOR pathway and a potential target for the treatment of cancers, insulin resistance and hamartoma syndromes.},

Moreover, phosphorylation of Csk-treated pp60c-src by Cdc2 also facilitated complete reactivation by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase CD45 or by a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to the C-terminal, regulatory phosphorylation site (Tyr-527). These data indicate that the Src homology 2 domain of Csk-phosphorylated pp60c-src was more accessible for intermolecular interactions and that Tyr-527 was more readily dephosphorylated after treatment with Cdc2.

In this study, we show that the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) c-Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) can be independently activated after Fibronectin (FN) stimulation and that their combined activity promotes signaling to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2)/MAP kinase through multiple pathways upstream of Ras. FN stimulation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts promotes c-Src and FAK association in the Triton-insoluble cell fraction, and the time course of FN-stimulated ERK2 activation paralleled that of Grb2 binding to FAK at Tyr-925 and Grb2 binding to Shc. Cytochalasin D treatment of fibroblasts inhibited FN-induced FAK in vitro kinase activity and signaling to ERK2, but it only partially inhibited c-Src activation. Treatment of fibroblasts with protein kinase C inhibitors or with the PTK inhibitor herbimycin A or PP1 resulted in reduced Src PTK activity, no Grb2 binding to FAK, and lowered levels of ERK2 activation. FN-stimulated FAK PTK activity was not significantly affected by herbimycin A treatment and, under these conditions, FAK autophosphorylation promoted Shc binding to FAK. In vitro, FAK directly phosphorylated Shc Tyr-317 to promote Grb2 binding, and in vivo Grb2 binding to Shc was observed in herbimycin A-treated fibroblasts after FN stimulation. Interestingly, c-Src in vitro phosphorylation of Shc promoted Grb2 binding to both wild-type and Phe-317 Shc. In vivo, Phe-317 Shc was tyrosine phosphorylated after FN stimulation of human 293T cells and its expression did not inhibit signaling to ERK2. Surprisingly, expression of Phe-925 FAK with Phe-317 Shc also did not block signaling to ERK2, whereas FN-stimulated signaling to ERK2 was inhibited by coexpression of an SH3 domain-inactivated mutant of Grb2. Our studies show that FN receptor integrin signaling upstream of Ras and ERK2 does not follow a linear pathway but that, instead, multiple Grb2-mediated interactions with Shc, FAK, and perhaps other yet-to-be-determined phosphorylated targets represent parallel signaling pathways that cooperate to promote maximal ERK2 activation.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer development is associated with increasing tissue stiffness over years. To more accurately mimic the onset of gradual matrix stiffening, which is not feasible with conventional static hydrogels, mammary epithelial cells (MECs) were cultured on methacrylated hyaluronic acid hydrogels whose stiffness can be dynamically modulated from "normal" ({$<$}150 Pascals) to "malignant" ({$>$}3,000 Pascals) via two-stage polymerization. MECs form and remain as spheroids, but begin to lose epithelial characteristics and gain mesenchymal morphology upon matrix stiffening. However, both the degree of matrix stiffening and culture time before stiffening play important roles in regulating this conversion as, in both cases, a subset of mammary spheroids remained insensitive to local matrix stiffness. This conversion depended neither on colony size nor cell density, and MECs did not exhibit "memory" of prior niche when serially cultured through cycles of compliant and stiff matrices. Instead, the transcription factor Twist1, transforming growth factor {$\beta$} (TGF{$\beta$}), and YAP activation appeared to modulate stiffness-mediated signaling; when stiffness-mediated signals were blocked, collective MEC phenotypes were reduced in favor of single MECs migrating away from spheroids. These data indicate a more complex interplay of time-dependent stiffness signaling, spheroid structure, and soluble cues that regulates MEC plasticity than suggested by previous models.},

After cleavage, p21Cip1/Waf1 loses its nuclear localization sequence and exits the nucleus. Cleavage of p21Cip1/Waf1 and p27Kip1 results in a substantial reduction in their association with nuclear cyclin-cdk2 complexes, leading to a dramatic induction of cdk2 activity. Dominant-negative cdk2, as well as a mutant of p21Cip1/Waf1 resistant to caspase cleavage, partially suppress apoptosis.

  abstract = {Despite detailed knowledge of the components of the spindle assembly checkpoint, a molecular explanation of how cells die after prolonged spindle checkpoint activation, and thus how microtubule inhibitors and other antimitotic drugs ultimately elicit their lethal effects, has yet to emerge. Mitotically arrested cells typically display extensive phosphorylation of two key antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-2, and evidence suggests that phosphorylation disables their antiapoptotic activity. However, the responsible kinase has remained elusive. In this report, evidence is presented that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B catalyzes mitotic-arrest-induced Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that CDK1 transiently and incompletely phosphorylates these proteins during normal mitosis. When mitosis is prolonged in the absence of microtubule inhibition, Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-2 become highly phosphorylated. Transient overexpression of nondegradable cyclin B1 caused apoptotic death, which was blocked by a phosphodefective Bcl-x(L) mutant but not by a phosphomimetic Bcl-x(L) mutant, confirming Bcl-x(L) as a key target of proapoptotic CDK1 signaling. These findings suggest a model whereby a switch in the duration of CDK1 activation, from transient during mitosis to sustained during mitotic arrest, dramatically increases the extent of Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-2 phosphorylation, resulting in inactivation of their antiapoptotic function. Thus, phosphorylation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins acts as a sensor for CDK1 signal duration and as a functional link coupling mitotic arrest to apoptosis.},

In this paper, we show that, in addition to volume, the geometry of this region has important consequences for the robustness and the fragility of a network. We develop an approximation within which we could algebraically specify the feasible region. We analyze the segment polarity gene network to illustrate our approach. The study of random walks in the parameter space and how they exit the feasible region provide us with a rich perspective on the different modes of failure of this network model. In particular, we found that, between two alternative ways of activating Wingless, one is more robust than the other. Our method provides a more complete measure of robustness to parameter variation. As a general modeling strategy, our approach is an interesting alternative to Boolean representation of biochemical networks.},

Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is crucial for maintaining appropriate cell number and tissue organization. It was therefore of interest to determine whether cell-matrix interactions affect apoptosis. The present report demonstrates that apoptosis was induced by disruption of the interactions between normal epithelial cells and extracellular matrix. We have termed this phenomenon "anoikis." Overexpression of bcl-2 protected cells against anoikis. Cellular sensitivity to anoikis was apparently regulated: (a) anoikis did not occur in normal fibroblasts; (b) it was abrogated in epithelial cells by transformation with v-Ha-ras, v-src, or treatment with phorbol ester; (c) sensitivity to anoikis was conferred upon HT1080 cells or v-Ha-ras-transformed MDCK cells by reverse-transformation with adenovirus E1a; (d) anoikis in MDCK cells was alleviated by the motility factor, scatter factor. The results suggest that the circumvention of anoikis accompanies the acquisition of anchorage independence or cell motility.},

By mechanotransduction systems, cells translate these stimuli into biochemical signals controlling multiple aspects of cell behaviour, including growth, differentiation and cancer malignant progression, but how rigidity mechanosensing is ultimately linked to activity of nuclear transcription factors remains poorly understood. Here we report the identification of the Yorkie-homologues YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, also known as WWTR1) as nuclear relays of mechanical signals exerted by ECM rigidity and cell shape. This regulation requires Rho GTPase activity and tension of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, but is independent of the Hippo/LATS cascade. Crucially, YAP/TAZ are functionally required for differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells induced by ECM stiffness and for survival of endothelial cells regulated by cell geometry; conversely, expression of activated YAP overrules physical constraints in dictating cell behaviour.

  abstract = {Cohesion between sister chromatids is established during DNA replication and depends on a multiprotein complex called cohesin. Attachment of sister kinetochores to the mitotic spindle during mitosis generates forces that would immediately split sister chromatids were it not opposed by cohesion. Cohesion is essential for the alignment of chromosomes in metaphase but must be abolished for sister separation to start during anaphase. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of sister-chromatid cohesion depends on a separating protein (separin) called Esp1 and is accompanied by dissociation from the chromosomes of the cohesion subunit Scc1. Here we show that Esp1 causes the dissociation of Scc1 from chromosomes by stimulating its cleavage by proteolysis. A mutant Scc1 is described that is resistant to Esp1-dependent cleavage and which blocks both sister-chromatid separation and the dissociation of Scc1 from chromosomes. The evolutionary conservation of separins indicates that the proteolytic cleavage of cohesion proteins might be a general mechanism for triggering anaphase.},

  abstract = {Most mammalian cells have the capacity to migrate. When placed into culture, cells will generally display a set rate of basal, unstimulated locomotion. The cells will begin to move in one direction and, after some time, change directions resulting in a random walk. External stimuli can influence cell motility in several ways to either enhance or retard the rate of migration (chemokinesis), to change the average amount of cell migration observed before the cell turns (persistence), or to increase the directionality of movement by limiting the number of turns made by the cells. Several factors have been identified that stimulate cell movement, but the signaling mechanisms that mediate this induced cell movement have only recently begun to be studied. In this review, we discuss the signals that support the directional movement of fibroblasts and epithelial cells in response to chemoattractant gradients. The work will emphasize studies carried out by our laboratory and others on the stimulation of cell motility by the PDGF. These results indicate that at least two sets of signaling molecules cooperate to regulate cell motility in vivo. These include phospholipase C-gamma, phosphoinositide-3' kinase and the Ras-GTPase activating protein Ras-GAP. The first set are those which bind to the intracellular domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase and bring about the phosphorylation and/or activation of intracellular effectors proximal to the receptor. The second is a set of down-stream effectors that regulate either the rate of cell movement or the directionality of that movement depending on the cell type. These include Ras and the Ras-related GTPase Rac along with free phosphoinositides and calcium ions that regulate the actin polymerization machinery. Signals that mediate nuclear changes leading to cell proliferation, such as elements of the MAP kinase pathway, do not appear to play a role in PDGF-stimulated cell migration. Current work thus suggests that a coordinated spatial regulation of signaling elements that interact with the cell membrane and cytoskeleton but not necessarily with nuclear elements is the controlling mediator of directional cell motility.},

We have shown recently that p27Kip1 overexpression delayed leukemic cell death in response to cytotoxic drugs. In transient transfection experiments, the p23 and the p15 N-terminal peptides generated by p27Kip1 proteolysis demonstrate an anti-apoptotic effect similar to that induced by the wild-type protein, whereas cleavage-resistant mutants have lost their protective effect. Moreover, stable transfection of a cleavage-resistant mutant of p27Kip1 sensitizes leukemic cells to drug-induced cell death. Altogether, these results indicate that proteolysis of p27Kip1 triggered by caspases mediates the anti-apoptotic activity of the protein.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The decision pro- or contra apoptosis is complex, involves a number of different inputs, and is central for the homeostasis of an individual cell as well as for the maintenance and regeneration of the complete organism. RESULTS: This study centers on Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis, and a complex and internally strongly linked network is assembled around the central FasL-mediated apoptosis cascade. Different bioinformatical techniques are employed and different crosstalk possibilities including the integrin pathway are considered. This network is translated into a Boolean network (74 nodes, 108 edges). System stability is dynamically sampled and investigated using the software SQUAD. Testing a number of alternative crosstalk possibilities and networks we find that there are four stable system states, two states comprising cell survival and two states describing apoptosis by the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways, respectively. The model is validated by comparing it to experimental data from kinetics of cytochrome c release and caspase activation in wildtype and Bid knockout cells grown on different substrates. Pathophysiological modifications such as input from cytomegalovirus proteins M36 and M45 again produces output behavior that well agrees with experimental data. CONCLUSION: A network model for apoptosis and crosstalk in hepatocytes shows four different system states and reproduces a number of different conditions around apoptosis including effects of different growth substrates and viral infections. It produces semi-quantitative predictions on the activity of individual nodes, agreeing with experimental data. The model (SBML format) and all data are available for further predictions and development.},

These studies established that YAP and TAZ are essential to trigger numerous cell-autonomous responses, such as sustained proliferation, cell plasticity, therapy resistance and metastasis. Yet tumours are complex entities, wherein cancer cells are just one of the components of a composite "tumour tissue". The other component, the tumour stroma, is composed of an extracellular matrix with aberrant mechanical properties and other cell types, including cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells. The stroma entertains multiple and bidirectional interactions with tumour cells, establishing dependencies essential to unleash tumorigenesis. The molecular players of such interplay remain partially understood. Here, we review the emerging role of YAP and TAZ in choreographing tumour-stromal interactions. YAP and TAZ act within tumour cells to orchestrate responses in stromal cells. Vice versa, YAP and TAZ in stromal cells trigger effects that positively feed back on the growth of tumour cells. Recognizing YAP and TAZ as a hub of the network of signals exchanged within the tumour microenvironment provides a fresh perspective on the molecular principles of tumour self-organization, promising to unveil numerous new vulnerabilities.},

While we have previously established that the timely activation of CyclinB1-Cdk1 in late G2 triggers mitotic entry, the upstream regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that Polo-like kinase~1 (Plk1) is required for entry into mitosis during an unperturbed cell cycle and is rapidly activated shortly before CyclinB1-Cdk1. We determine that Plk1 associates with the Cdc25C1 phosphatase and induces its phosphorylation before mitotic entry. Plk1-dependent Cdc25C1 phosphosites are sufficient to promote mitotic entry, even when Plk1 activity is inhibited. Furthermore, we find that activation of Plk1 during G2 relies on CyclinA2-Cdk activity levels. Our findings thus elucidate a critical role for Plk1 in CyclinB1-Cdk1 activation and mitotic entry and outline how CyclinA2-Cdk, an S-promoting factor, poises cells for commitment to mitosis.},

Rereplication seen after Emi1 depletion is due to premature activation of APC/C that results in destabilization of geminin and cyclin A, two proteins shown here to play redundant roles in preventing rereplication in mammalian cells. Geminin is known to inhibit the replication initiation factor Cdt1. The rereplication block by cyclin A is mediated through its association with S and G2/M cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), Cdk2 and Cdk1, suggesting that phosphorylation of proteins by cyclin A-Cdk is responsible for the block. Rereplication upon Emi1 depletion activates the DNA damage checkpoint pathways. These data suggest that Emi1 plays a critical role in preserving genome integrity by blocking rereplication, revealing a previously unrecognized function of this inhibitor of APC/C.},

The fly retina contains two types of ommatidia, called 'pale' and 'yellow', defined by different rhodopsin pairs expressed in R7 and R8 cells. Similar to the human cone photoreceptors, these ommatidial subtypes are distributed stochastically in the retina. The choice between pale versus yellow ommatidia is made in R7 cells, which then impose their fate onto R8. Here we report that the Drosophila dioxin receptor Spineless is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the ommatidial mosaic. A short burst of spineless expression at mid-pupation in a large subset of R7 cells precedes rhodopsin expression. In spineless mutants, all R7 and most R8 cells adopt the pale fate, whereas overexpression of spineless is sufficient to induce the yellow R7 fate. Therefore, this study suggests that the entire retinal mosaic required for colour vision is defined by the stochastic expression of a single transcription factor, Spineless.},

Interphase mitochondria have been described as an interconnected network that fragments as cells enter mitosis, and this mitotic mitochondrial fragmentation is known to be regulated by the dynamin-related GTPase Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1), a key component of the mitochondrial division machinery. Loss of Drp1 function and the subsequent failure of mitochondrial division during mitosis lead to incomplete cytokinesis and the unequal distribution of mitochondria into daughter cells. During mitotic exit and interphase, the mitochondrial network reforms. Here we demonstrate that changes in mitochondrial dynamics as cells exit mitosis are driven in part through ubiquitylation of Drp1, catalyzed by the APC/C(Cdh1) (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its coactivator Cdh1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Importantly, inhibition of Cdh1-mediated Drp1 ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation during interphase prevents the normal G1 phase regrowth of mitochondrial networks following cell division.},

Furthermore, differences in phosphorylation of serine residues for BAD WT and tBAD were identified. BAD WT was phosphorylated at positions S136 and S155, whereas tBAD was phosphorylated at positions S112, S136, and S155. LNCaP stably expressing BAD mutated at serine 112 to alanine was less sensitive to TRAIL treatment when compared to LNCaP expressing BAD WT.

During angiogenic sprouting, endothelial cells express many of the same genes and break down basement membrane; however, they retain intercellular junctions and migrate as a connected train of cells rather than as individual cells. This has been termed a partial endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. A key regulatory check-point determines whether cells undergo a full or a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions/endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition; however, very little is known about how this switch is controlled.

  abstract = {Deregulated expression of c-myc can induce cell proliferation in established cell lines and in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), through a combination of both transcriptional activation and repression by Myc. Here we show that a Myc-associated transcription factor, Miz-1, arrests cells in G1 phase and inhibits cyclin D-associated kinase activity. Miz-1 upregulates expression of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) inhibitor p15INK4b by binding to the initiator element of the p15INK4b promoter. Myc and Max form a complex with Miz-1 at the p15 initiator and inhibit transcriptional activation by Miz-1. Expression of Myc in primary cells inhibits the accumulation of p15INK4b that is associated with cellular senescence; conversely, deletion of c-myc in an established cell line activates p15INK4b expression. Alleles of c-myc that are unable to bind to Miz-1 fail to inhibit accumulation of p15INK4b messenger RNA in primary cells and are, as a consequence, deficient in immortalization.},

Systemic inflammation and damage of blood-brain barrier (BBB) are etiologic cofactors in the pathogenesis of pilocarpine SE while acute osmotic disruption of the BBB is sufficient to elicit seizures. Whether an inflammatory-vascular-BBB mechanism could apply to the lithium-pilocarpine model is unknown. LiCl facilitated seizures induced by low-dose pilocarpine by activation of circulating T-lymphocytes and mononuclear cells. Serum IL-1beta levels increased and BBB damage occurred concurrently to increased theta EEG activity. These events occurred prior to SE induced by cholinergic exposure. SE was elicited by lithium and pilocarpine irrespective of their sequence of administration supporting a common pathogenetic mechanism. Since IL-1beta is an etiologic trigger for BBB breakdown and its serum elevation occurs before onset of SE early after LiCl and pilocarpine injections, we tested the hypothesis that intravenous administration of IL-1 receptor antagonists (IL-1ra) may prevent pilocarpine-induced seizures. Animals pre-treated with IL-1ra exhibited significant reduction of SE onset and of BBB damage. Our data support the concept of targeting systemic inflammation and BBB for the prevention of status epilepticus.},

The endothelial cells (ECs) that line the lumens of blood and lymphatic vessels play an integral role in the regional specialization of vascular structure and physiology. However, our understanding of EC diversity is limited. To explore EC specialization on a global scale, we used DNA microarrays to determine the expression profile of 53 cultured ECs. We found that ECs from different blood vessels and microvascular ECs from different tissues have distinct and characteristic gene expression profiles. Pervasive differences in gene expression patterns distinguish the ECs of large vessels from microvascular ECs. We identified groups of genes characteristic of arterial and venous endothelium. Hey2, the human homologue of the zebrafish gene gridlock, was selectively expressed in arterial ECs and induced the expression of several arterial-specific genes. Several genes critical in the establishment of left/right asymmetry were expressed preferentially in venous ECs, suggesting coordination between vascular differentiation and body plan development. Tissue-specific expression patterns in different tissue microvascular ECs suggest they are distinct differentiated cell types that play roles in the local physiology of their respective organs and tissues.},

Intracellular propagation of the signal occurs by phosphorylation of intracellular proteins of the Smad family. Smad7 belongs to the subclass of inhibitory Smads that function as antagonists of TGF-beta signaling. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human placental cDNA expression library using full-length mouse Smad7 as bait identified Yes-Associated Protein (YAP65) as a novel Smad7-interacting protein. The association of Smad7 with YAP65 was confirmed using co-expressed tagged proteins in COS-7 cells. Deletion of the PY motif of Smad7 reduced but did not abolish YAP65-Smad7 association, suggesting the existence of several interacting domains. We demonstrate that YAP65 potentiates the inhibitory activity of Smad7 against TGF-beta-induced, Smad3/4-dependent, gene transactivation. Furthermore, YAP65 augments the association of Smad7 to activated TGF-beta receptor type I (TbetaRI), whereas YAP65(1-301), which exerts a dominant-negative effect against Smad7-driven inhibition of TGF-beta signaling, reduces these interactions. Together, these data provide the first evidence that YAP65 is a Smad7 partner that facilitates the recruitment of the latter to activated TbetaRI, and enhances the inhibitory activity of Smad7 against TGF-beta signaling.},

  abstract = {Plants both lose water and take in carbon dioxide through microscopic stomatal pores, each of which is regulated by a surrounding pair of guard cells. During drought, the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits stomatal opening and promotes stomatal closure, thereby promoting water conservation. Dozens of cellular components have been identified to function in ABA regulation of guard cell volume and thus of stomatal aperture, but a dynamic description is still not available for this complex process. Here we synthesize experimental results into a consistent guard cell signal transduction network for ABA-induced stomatal closure, and develop a dynamic model of this process. Our model captures the regulation of more than 40 identified network components, and accords well with previous experimental results at both the pathway and whole-cell physiological level. By simulating gene disruptions and pharmacological interventions we find that the network is robust against a significant fraction of possible perturbations. Our analysis reveals the novel predictions that the disruption of membrane depolarizability, anion efflux, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, cytosolic pH increase, the phosphatidic acid pathway, or K(+) efflux through slowly activating K(+) channels at the plasma membrane lead to the strongest reduction in ABA responsiveness. Initial experimental analysis assessing ABA-induced stomatal closure in the presence of cytosolic pH clamp imposed by the weak acid butyrate is consistent with model prediction. Simulations of stomatal response as derived from our model provide an efficient tool for the identification of candidate manipulations that have the best chance of conferring increased drought stress tolerance and for the prioritization of future wet bench analyses. Our method can be readily applied to other biological signaling networks to identify key regulatory components in systems where quantitative information is limited.},

An expression screen for proteins that bind to Bcl-2 yielded a small novel protein, denoted Bim, whose only similarity to any known protein is the short (nine amino acid) BH3 motif shared by most Bcl-2 homologues. Bim provokes apoptosis, and the BH3 region is required for Bcl-2 binding and for most of its cytotoxicity. Like Bcl-2, Bim possesses a hydrophobic C-terminus and localizes to intracytoplasmic membranes. Three Bim isoforms, probably generated by alternative splicing, all induce apoptosis, the shortest being the most potent. Wild-type Bcl-2 associates with Bim in vivo and modulates its death function, whereas Bcl-2 mutants that lack survival function do neither. Significantly, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, the two closest homologues of Bcl-2, also bind to Bim and inhibit its activity, but more distant viral homologues, adenovirus E1B19K and Epstein-Barr virus BHRF-1, can do neither. Hence, Bim appears to act as a 'death ligand' which can only neutralize certain members of the pro-survival Bcl-2 sub-family.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors are adaptor molecules that detect regulatory sequences in the DNA and target the assembly of protein complexes that control gene expression. Yet much of the DNA in the eukaryotic cell is in nucleosomes and thereby occluded by histones, and can be further occluded by higher-order chromatin structures and repressor complexes. Indeed, genome-wide location analyses have revealed that, for all transcription factors tested, the vast majority of potential DNA-binding sites are unoccupied, demonstrating the inaccessibility of most of the nuclear DNA. This raises the question of how target sites at silent genes become bound de novo by transcription factors, thereby initiating regulatory events in chromatin. Binding cooperativity can be sufficient for many kinds of factors to simultaneously engage a target site in chromatin and activate gene expression. However, in cases in which the binding of a series of factors is sequential in time and thus not initially cooperative, special ``pioneer transcription factors'' can be the first to engage target sites in chromatin. Such initial binding can passively enhance transcription by reducing the number of additional factors that are needed to bind the DNA, culminating in activation. In addition, pioneer factor binding can actively open up the local chromatin and directly make it competent for other factors to bind. Passive and active roles for the pioneer factor FoxA occur in embryonic development, steroid hormone induction, and human cancers. Herein we review the field and describe how pioneer factors may enable cellular reprogramming.},

The degree of Wnt3a-induced proliferation was reduced by beta-catenin small interfering RNA (siRNA) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) siRNA, indicating that both the ERK and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways are involved in Wnt3a-induced proliferation. Wnt3a immediately and transiently activated the Raf-1-MEK-ERK cascade in a manner distinct from that of the beta-catenin increase seen in cells treated with Wnt3a. Wnt3a-induced ERK activation was maintained even though basal ERK activities were reduced by beta-catenin siRNA, indicating that Wnt3a may activate the ERK pathway independently of beta-catenin. The ERK pathway was however, activated by beta-catenin transfection, which was abolished by co-transfection with dominant-negative Tcf-4. Therefore, ERK pathway activation by Wnt signaling could occur at multiple levels, including beta-catenin-independent direct signaling resulting from a Wnt3a and beta-catenin/Tcf-4-dependent post gene transcriptional event. Wnt3a stimulated the G1 to S phase cell cycle progression. This stimulation was reduced by the ERK pathway inhibitor, indicating that Wnt3a promotes proliferation by stimulating the ERK pathway. Wnt3a therefore stimulates the proliferation of fibroblast cells, at least in part, via activation of the ERK and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) signaling is an obligate requirement for normal development and pathological angiogenesis such as cancer and age-related macular degeneration. Although autophosphorylation of tyrosine 1173 (Y1173) of VEGFR-2 is considered a focal point for its angiogenic signal relay, however, the mechanism of phosphorylation of Y1173, signaling proteins that are recruited to this residue and their role in angiogenesis is not fully understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we demonstrate that c-Src kinase directly through its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and indirectly via c-Cbl binds to phospho-Y1057 of VEGFR-2. Activation of c-Src kinase by a positive feedback mechanism phosphorylates VEGFR-2 at multi-docking site, Y1173. c-Src also catalyzes tyrosine phosphorylation of IQGAP1 and acts as an adaptor to bridge IQGAP1 to VEGFR-2. In turn, IQGAP1 activates b-Raf and mediates proliferation of endothelial cells. Silencing expression of IQGAP1 and b-Raf revealed that their activity is essential for VEGF to stimulate angiogenesis in an in vivo angiogenesis model of chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Angiogenesis contributes to the pathology of numerous human diseases ranging from cancer to age-related macular degeneration. Determining molecular mechanism of tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and identification of molecules that are relaying its angiogenic signaling may identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention against angiogenesis-associated diseases. Our study shows that recruitment and activation of c-Src by VEGFR-2 plays a pivotal role in relaying angiogenic signaling of VEGFR-2; it phosphorylates VEGFR-2 at Y1173, facilitates association and activation of IQGAP1 and other signaling proteins to VEGFR-2. IQGAP1-dependent signaling, in part, is critically required for endothelial cell proliferation, a key step in angiogenesis. Thus, Y1057 of VEGFR-2 serves to regulate VEGFR-2 function in a combinatorial manner by supporting both diversity of recruitment of angiogenic signaling proteins to VEGFR-2, and its ability to promote angiogenesis.},

Abscission failure with an unusually elongated intercellular bridge containing the midbody is induced by treatment with the chemical Src inhibitors PP2 and SU6656 or expression of membrane-anchored Csk chimeras. By anti-phosphotyrosine immunofluorescence and live cell imaging, completion of abscission requires Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation during early stages of mitosis (before cleavage furrow formation), which is subsequently delivered to the midbody through Rab11-driven vesicle transport. Treatment with U0126, a MEK inhibitor, decreases tyrosine phosphorylation levels at the midbody, leading to abscission failure. Activated ERK by MEK-catalyzed dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues in the TEY sequence, which is strongly detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, is transported to the midbody in a Rab11-dependent manner. Src kinase activity during the early mitosis mediates ERK activation in late cytokinesis, indicating that Src-mediated signaling for abscission is spatially and temporally transmitted. Thus, these results suggest that recruitment of activated ERK, which is phosphorylated by MEK downstream of Src kinases, to the midbody plays an important role in completion of abscission.},

  abstract = {Forward and backward transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes play crucial roles in embryonic development and tissue repair. Aberrantly regulated transitions are also a hallmark of cancer metastasis. The genetic network that regulates these transitions appears to allow for the existence of a hybrid phenotype (epithelial/mesenchymal). Hybrid cells are endowed with mixed epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, enabling specialized capabilities such as collective cell migration. Cell-fate determination between the three phenotypes is in fact regulated by a circuit composed of two highly interconnected chimeric modules--the miR-34/SNAIL and the miR-200/ZEB mutual-inhibition feedback circuits. Here, we used detailed modeling of microRNA-based regulation to study this core unit. More specifically, we investigated the functions of the two isolated modules and subsequently of the combined unit when the two modules are integrated into the full regulatory circuit. We found that miR-200/ZEB forms a tristable circuit that acts as a ternary switch, driven by miR-34/SNAIL, that is a monostable module that acts as a noise-buffering integrator of internal and external signals. We propose to associate the three stable states--(1,0), (high miR-200)/(low ZEB); (0,1), (low miR-200)/(high ZEB); and (1/2,1/2), (medium miR-200)/(medium ZEB)--with the epithelial, mesenchymal, and hybrid phenotypes, respectively. Our (1/2,1/2) state hypothesis is consistent with recent experimental studies (e.g., ZEB expression measurements in collectively migrating cells) and explains the lack of observed mesenchymal-to-hybrid transitions in metastatic cells and in induced pluripotent stem cells. Testable predictions of dynamic gene expression during complete and partial transitions are presented.},

Using conditional knockout mice, we demonstrate that the Merlin/NF2 tumor suppressor and the YAP oncoprotein function antagonistically to regulate liver development. While inactivation of Yap led to loss of hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, inactivation of Nf2 led to hepatocellular carcinoma and bile duct hamartoma. Strikingly, the Nf2-deficient phenotypes in multiple tissues were largely suppressed by heterozygous deletion of Yap, suggesting that YAP is a major effector of Merlin/NF2 in growth regulation. Our studies link Merlin/NF2 to mammalian Hippo signaling and implicate YAP activation as a mediator of pathologies relevant to Neurofibromatosis 2.},

In a highly conserved manner, cells disassemble adhesion complexes, round up, and retract from their surroundings before division, suggestive of a primordial link between the cell cycle machinery and the regulation of cell adhesion to the ECM. In this study, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) mediates this link. CDK1, in complex with cyclin A2, promotes adhesion complex and actin cytoskeleton organization during interphase and mediates a large increase in adhesion complex area as cells transition from G1 into S. Adhesion complex area decreases in G2, and disassembly occurs several hours before mitosis. This loss requires elevated cyclin B1 levels and is caused by inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1\textendash cyclin complexes. The inactivation of CDK1 is therefore the trigger that initiates remodeling of adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton in preparation for rapid entry into mitosis.},

HSCs normally reside within the bone marrow niche of an adult mammal. The embryonic development of HSCs is a complex process that involves the migration of developing HSCs in multiple anatomical sites. Throughout the process, developing HSCs receive internal (transcriptional program) and external (HSC niche) signals, which direct them to maintain balance between self-renewal and differentiation, also to generate a pool of HSCs. In physiological condition HSCs differentiate into all mature cell types present in the blood. However, in pathological condition they may differentiate into non-hematological cells according to the need of the body. It was shown that HSCs can transdifferentiate into cell types that do not belong to the hematopoietic system suggests a complete paradigm shift of the hierarchical hematopoietic tree. This review describes the developmental origins and regulation of HSCs focusing on developmental signals that induce the adult hematopoietic stem cell program, as these informations are very critical for manipulating conditions for expansion of HSCs in ex vivo condition.

Our understanding of the regulation and biology of these important signaling proteins has increased tremendously since their discovery in the mid-1990s. PAKs 1\textendash 3 are activated by a variety of GTPase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. This complexity reflects the contributions of PAK function in many cellular signaling pathways and the need to carefully control PAK action in a highly localized manner. PAKs serve as important regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility, transcription through MAP kinase cascades, death and survival signaling, and cell-cycle progression. Consequently, PAKs have also been implicated in a number of pathological conditions and in cell transformation. We propose here a key role for PAK action in coordinating the dynamics of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons during directional motility of cells, as well as in other functions requiring cytoskeletal polarization.},

Here, we map the two-dimensional input functions of 19 sugar-utilization genes at high resolution in living E. coli cells. We find diverse, intricately shaped input functions, despite the similarity in the regulatory circuitry of these genes. Surprisingly, some of the input functions are nonmonotonic, peaking at intermediate signal levels. Furthermore, most of the input functions show separation of variables, in the sense that they can be described as the product of simple functions that depend on a single input. This first broad survey of two-dimensional input functions can be extended to map the logic of gene regulation in other systems.},

Here, we show that both early-passage Foxm1(-)(/)(-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human osteosarcoma U2OS cells depleted of FoxM1 protein by small interfering RNA fail to grow in culture due to a mitotic block and accumulate nuclear levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) proteins p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1). Using quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression assays, we show that FoxM1 is essential for transcription of the mitotic regulatory genes Cdc25B, Aurora B kinase, survivin, centromere protein A (CENPA), and CENPB. We also identify the mechanism by which FoxM1 deficiency causes elevated nuclear levels of the CDKI proteins p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1). We provide evidence that FoxM1 is essential for transcription of Skp2 and Cks1, which are specificity subunits of the Skp1-Cullin 1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex that targets these CDKI proteins for degradation during the G(1)/S transition. Moreover, early-passage Foxm1(-)(/)(-) MEFs display premature senescence as evidenced by high expression of the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, p19(ARF), and p16(INK4A) proteins. Taken together, these results demonstrate that FoxM1 regulates transcription of cell cycle genes critical for progression into S-phase and mitosis.},

  abstract = {ZFHX1A is expressed in proliferating cells in the developing embryo, and in the present study we provide evidence that its expression is confined to proliferating cells through dependence on the Rb (retinoblastoma protein) family/E2F cell cycle pathway. Mutation of the Rb or E2F1 genes lead to induction of ZFHX1A mRNA, implying that the Rb-E2F1 repressor complex is important for repression of ZFHX1A. This repression is associated with recruitment of an E2F-Rb-histone deacetylase repressor complex to the promoter. A dominant-negative form of E2F1 inhibited ZFHX1A expression in p16INK4a- cells where Rb is constitutively hyperphosphorylated and inactive, suggesting that E2F can contribute to ZFHX1A transactivation in the absence of functional Rb. ZFHX1A is an E-box-binding transcription factor whose binding sites overlap with those bound by Snail1 and 2, and ZFHX1B/SIP1 (leading to at least partially overlapping function; for example, each of the proteins can repress E-cadherin expression). We found that expression of Snail1 and ZFHX1B/SIP1 is also regulated by E2Fs, but in contrast with ZFHX1A this regulation is Rb-family-independent. Snail2 expression was unaffected by either E2F or the Rb family. We propose that the differential effects of the Rb family/E2F pathway on expression of these E-box-binding proteins are important in maintaining their distinct patterns (and thus distinct functions) during embryogenesis.},

  abstract = {The development and spread of mammary carcinomas require synergetic interplay between tumor cells and their microenvironment through paracrine secretions, which are still not well defined. We have shown here that interleukin-6 (IL-6), either recombinant or secreted from highly invasive breast cancer cells, down-regulates the tumor suppressor proteins p16(INK4A), p21(WAF1), and p53 and activates breast stromal fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. The formation of myofibroblasts requires p16(INK4A) down-regulation and the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Indeed, the transcription factor STAT3 positively controls the expression of the three major myofibroblast markers, SDF-1, {$\alpha$}-smooth muscle actin ({$\alpha$}-SMA), and TGF-{$\beta$}1, and mediates IL-6-related down-regulation of p16(INK4A), p21(WAF1), and p53 as well as the activation of stromal fibroblasts. Importantly, these effects were mediated through STAT3-dependent up-regulation of the mRNA-binding protein AUF1, whose promoter contains three canonical STAT3 binding sites. AUF1 binds the SDF-1, {$\alpha$}-SMA, TGF-{$\beta$}1, and IL-6 mRNAs and reduces their turnover. Consequently, specific AUF1 down-regulation inhibits IL-6-dependent activation of breast stromal fibroblasts, whereas AUF1 ectopic expression of p37(AUF1) activated these cells and enhanced their paracrine induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells, which shows a non-cell-autonomous oncogenic function of AUF1. Together, these results demonstrate a major role of IL-6 in activating breast stromal fibroblasts through STAT3-dependent AUF1 induction.},

Specialized subsets of epithelial cells-including secretory and ciliated cells-differentiate from basal stem cells to collectively protect the upper airway2-4. Allergic inflammation can develop from persistent activation5 of type 2 immunity6 in the upper airway, resulting in chronic rhinosinusitis, which ranges in severity from rhinitis to severe nasal polyps7. Basal cell hyperplasia is a hallmark of severe disease7-9, but it is not known how these progenitor cells2,10,11 contribute to clinical presentation and barrier tissue dysfunction in humans. Here we profile primary human surgical chronic rhinosinusitis samples (18,036 cells, n\,=\,12) that span the disease spectrum using Seq-Well for massively~parallel single-cell RNA~sequencing12, report transcriptomes for human respiratory epithelial, immune and stromal cell types and subsets from a type 2 inflammatory disease, and map key mediators. By comparison with nasal scrapings (18,704 cells, n\,=\,9), we define signatures of core, healthy, inflamed and polyp secretory cells. We reveal marked differences between the epithelial compartments of the non-polyp and polyp cellular ecosystems, identifying and validating a global reduction in cellular diversity of polyps characterized by basal cell hyperplasia, concomitant decreases in glandular cells, and phenotypic shifts in secretory cell antimicrobial expression. We detect an aberrant basal progenitor differentiation trajectory in polyps, and propose cell-intrinsic13, epigenetic14,15 and extrinsic factors11,16,17 that lock polyp basal cells into this uncommitted state. Finally, we functionally demonstrate that ex vivo cultured basal cells retain intrinsic memory of IL-4/IL-13 exposure, and test the potential for clinical blockade of the IL-4 receptor {$\alpha$}-subunit to modify basal and secretory cell states in vivo. Overall, we find that reduced epithelial diversity stemming from functional shifts in basal cells is a key characteristic of type 2 immune-mediated barrier tissue dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that epithelial stem cells may contribute to the persistence of human disease by serving as repositories for allergic memories.},

  abstract = {Metastasis is a multistep process including dissociation of cancer cells from primary sites, survival in the vascular system, and proliferation in distant target organs. As a barrier to metastasis, cells normally undergo an apoptotic process known as "anoikis," a form of cell death due to loss of contact with the extracellular matrix or neighboring cells. Cancer cells acquire anoikis resistance to survive after detachment from the primary sites and travel through the circulatory and lymphatic systems to disseminate throughout the body. Because recent technological advances enable us to detect rare circulating tumor cells, which are anoikis resistant, currently, anoikis resistance becomes a hot topic in cancer research. Detailed molecular and functional analyses of anoikis resistant cells may provide insight into the biology of cancer metastasis and identify novel therapeutic targets for prevention of cancer dissemination. This paper comprehensively describes recent investigations of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying anoikis and anoikis resistance in relation to intrinsic and extrinsic death signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, growth factor receptors, energy metabolism, reactive oxygen species, membrane microdomains, and lipid rafts.},

We previously identified IQ-domain GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) as a novel VEGF receptor 2 binding scaffold protein involved in endothelial migration. However, its role in VSMC migration and neointimal formation in vivo is unknown. Here we show that PDGF stimulation rapidly promotes IQGAP1 association with PDGF receptor-{$\beta$} (PDGFR) as well as IQGAP1 tyrosine phosphorylation in cultured VSMC. Overexpression or knockdown of IQGAP1 enhances or inhibits PDGFR autophosphorylation (p-PDGFR), respectively. Immunofluorescence and cell fractionation analysis reveals that PDGF-induced p-PDGFR localized in focal adhesions (FAs), but not caveolae/lipid rafts, is inhibited by IQGAP1 knockdown with siRNA. PDGF stimulation promotes IQGAP1 association with PDGFR/FA signaling protein complex. Functionally, IQGAP1 siRNA inhibits PDGF-induced FA formation as well as VSMC migration induced by PDGF. In vivo, IQGAP1 expression is markedly increased at neointimal VSMC in wire-injured femoral arteries. Mice lacking IQGAP1 exhibit impaired neointimal formation in response to vascular injury. In summary, IQGAP1, through interaction with PDGFR and FA signaling proteins, promotes activation of PDGFR in FAs as well as FA formation, which may contribute to VSMC migration and neointimal formation after injury. Our findings provide insight into IQGAP1 as a potential therapeutic target for vascular migration-related diseases.},

Expression of the nuclear factor ZEB1 induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and confers a metastatic phenotype on carcinomas by repressing the E-cadherin gene at the transcriptional level. In this study, we show that ZEB1 interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling protein BRG1 to regulate E-cadherin independently of CtBP, its traditional co-repressor. Blocking the interaction between ZEB1 and BRG1 induces expression of E-cadherin and downregulation of the mesenchymal marker vimentin. ZEB1 and BRG1 colocalize in E-cadherin-negative cells from cancer lines and in the stroma of normal colon. Colocalization of ZEB1 and BRG1 in epithelial cells is only found in those de-differentiated cells characterized by nuclear beta-catenin staining at the invasive edge of the tumor. Our results identify ZEB1/BRG1 as a new transcriptional mechanism regulating E-cadherin expression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation that may be involved during the initial stages of tumor invasion.},

  abstract = {Regulated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay is an essential mechanism that governs proper control of gene expression. In fact, many of the most physiologically potent proteins are encoded by short-lived mRNAs, many of which contain AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). AREs target mRNAs for post-transcriptional regulation, generally rapid decay, but also stabilization and translation inhibition. AREs control mRNA turnover and translation activities through association with trans-acting RNA-binding proteins that display high affinity for these AU-rich regulatory elements. AU-rich element RNA-binding protein (AUF1), also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (HNRNPD), is an extensively studied AU-rich binding protein (AUBP). AUF1 has been shown to regulate ARE-mRNA turnover, primarily functioning to promote rapid ARE-mRNA degradation. In certain cellular contexts, AUF1 has also been shown to regulate gene expression at the translational and even the transcriptional level. AUF1 comprises a family of four related protein isoforms derived from a common pre-mRNA by differential exon splicing. AUF1 isoforms have been shown to display multiple and distinct functions that include the ability to target ARE-mRNA stability or decay, and transcriptional activation of certain genes that is controlled by their differential subcellular locations, expression levels, and post-translational modifications. AUF1 has been implicated in controlling a variety of physiological functions through its ability to regulate the expression of numerous mRNAs containing 3'-UTR AREs, thereby coordinating functionally related pathways. This review highlights the physiological functions of AUF1-mediated regulation of mRNA and gene expression, and the consequences of deficient AUF1 levels in different physiological settings.},

The kinases targeting Cdc25A for proteolysis during early cell-cycle phases have not been identified, and mechanistic insight into the cause of Cdc25A overproduction in human cancers is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylates Cdc25A to promote its proteolysis in early cell-cycle phases. Phosphorylation by GSK-3beta requires priming of Cdc25A, and this can be catalyzed by polo-like kinase 3 (Plk-3). Importantly, a strong correlation between Cdc25A overproduction and GSK-3beta inactivation was observed in human tumor tissues, indicating that GSK-3beta inactivation may account for Cdc25A overproduction in a subset of human tumors.},

Whereas lower eukaryotes typically contain a single Plk, mammalian cells express several closely related but functionally distinct Plks. We describe here a chemical genetic system in which a single Plk family member, Plk1, can be inactivated with high selectivity and temporal resolution by using an allele-specific, small-molecule inhibitor, as well as the application of this system to dissect Plk1's role in cytokinesis. To do this, we disrupted both copies of the PLK1 locus in human cells through homologous recombination and then reconstituted Plk1 activity by using either the wild-type kinase (Plk1(wt)) or a mutant version whose catalytic pocket has been enlarged to accommodate bulky purine analogs (Plk1(as)). When cultured in the presence of these analogs, Plk1(as) cells accumulate in prometaphase with defects that parallel those found in PLK1(Delta/Delta) cells. In addition, acute treatment of Plk1(as) cells during anaphase prevents recruitment of both Plk1 itself and the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) Ect2 to the central spindle, abolishes RhoA GTPase localization to the equatorial cortex, and suppresses cleavage furrow formation and cell division. Our studies define and illuminate a late mitotic function of Plk1 that, although difficult or impossible to detect in Plk1-depleted cells, is readily revealed with chemical genetics.},

In this paper we provide a clear overview of the concepts used in Boolean simulations, present a software library that can perform these simulations based on simple text inputs and give three case studies. The large scale simulations in these case studies demonstrate the Boolean paradigms and their applicability as well as the advanced features and complex use cases that our software package allows.

In these cases, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism of cellular stability and how the transitions happen between different cell states, which is controlled by a gene regulatory network (GRN) hard-wired in the genome. Here we use Boolean modeling of GRN to study the cell state transition of EMT and systematically compare four available methods to calculate the cellular stability of three cell states in EMT in both normal and genetically mutated cases. The results produced from four methods generally agree but do not totally agree with each other. We show that distribution of one-degree neighborhood of cell states, which are the nearest states by Hamming distance, causes the difference among the methods. From that, we propose a new method based on one-degree neighborhood, which is the simplest one and agrees with other methods to estimate the cellular stability in all scenarios of our EMT model. This new method will help the researchers in the field of cell differentiation and cell reprogramming to calculate cellular stability using Boolean model, and then rationally design their experimental protocols to manipulate the cell state transition.},

  abstract = {Anoikis is a programmed cell death induced upon cell detachment from extracellular matrix, behaving as a critical mechanism in preventing adherent-independent cell growth and attachment to an inappropriate matrix, thus avoiding colonizing of distant organs. As anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, two features associated with anoikis resistance, are vital steps during cancer progression and metastatic colonization, the ability of cancer cells to resist anoikis has now attracted main attention from the scientific community. Cancer cells develop anoikis resistance due to several mechanisms, including change in integrins' repertoire allowing them to grow in different niches, activation of a plethora of inside-out pro-survival signals as over-activation of receptors due to sustained autocrine loops, oncogene activation, growth factor receptor overexpression, or mutation/upregulation of key enzymes involved in integrin or growth factor receptor signaling. In addition, tumor microenvironment has also been acknowledged to contribute to anoikis resistance of bystander cancer cells, by modulating matrix stiffness, enhancing oxidative stress, producing pro-survival soluble factors, triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition and self-renewal ability, as well as leading to metabolic deregulations of cancer cells. All these events help cancer cells to inhibit the apoptosis machinery and sustain pro-survival signals after detachment, counteracting anoikis and constituting promising targets for anti-metastatic pharmacological therapy.

  abstract = {Cutaneous wound healing is pivotal for human skin to regain barrier function against pathogens. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to play regulatory roles in wound healing. However, the mechanism of miRNA regulation remains largely unknown. In this study, we focused on microRNA-200b/c-3p (miR-200b/c-3p) whose expression was abundant in intact epidermis, but dramatically decreased in skin wounds. In silico prediction identified RAC1 as a potential miR-200b/c-3p target. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-200b/c-p repressed RAC1 by direct targeting to its mRNA 3'UTR. Consistently, miR-200b/c-3p expression was discordantly related to RAC1 protein level during wound healing. Forced miR-200b/c-3p expression repressed RAC1 and inhibited keratinocyte migration as well as re-epithelialization in a mouse back skin full-thickness wound healing model. Mechanistically, miR-200b/c-3p modulated RAC1 to inhibit cell migration by repressing lamellipodia formation and intercellular adhesion dissolution in keratinocytes. Furthermore, we found that TGF-{$\beta$}1, which was highly expressed in skin wounds, contributed to the downregulation of miR-200b/c-3p in wound edge keratinocytes. Taken together, miR-200b/c-3p-mediated RAC1 repression inhibited keratinocyte migration to delay re-epithelialization. TGF-{$\beta$}1 induction attenuated miR-200b/c-3p regulation of RAC1 signaling in cutaneous wounds and the repression of miR-200b/c-3p accelerated keratinocyte migration to promote wound healing. Our data provide new insight into how miR-200b/c-3p affects keratinocyte migration and highlight the potential of miR-200b/c-3p targeting for accelerating wound healing.},

We report that: (1) cancer cells display striking anoikis resistance, as opposed to undifferentiated/differentiated IECs; (2) under anoikis conditions and consequent Fak down-activation, cancer cells nevertheless exhibit sustained Fak-Src interactions and Src/MEK/Erk activation, unlike undifferentiated/differentiated IECs; however, HCT116 and HT29 cells exhibit a PI3-K/Akt-1 down-activation, as undifferentiated/differentiated IECs, whereas T84 cells do not; (3) cancer cells require MEK/Erk for survival, as differentiated (but not undifferentiated) IECs; however, T84 cells do not require Fak and HCT116 cells do not require PI3-K/Akt-1, in contrast to the other cells studied; (4) Src acts as a cornerstone in Fak-mediated signaling to MEK/Erk and PI3-K/Akt-1 in T84 cells, as in undifferentiated IECs, whereas PI3-K/Akt-1 is Src-independent in HCT116, HT29 cells, as in differentiated IECs; and (5) EGFR activity inhibition abrogates anoikis resistance in cancer cells through a loss of Fak-Src interactions and down-activation of Src/MEK/Erk (T84, HCT116, HT29 cells) and PI3-K/Akt-1 (T84 cells). Hence, despite distinctions in signaling behavior not necessarily related to undifferentiated or differentiated IECs, intestinal epithelial cancer cells commonly display an EGFR-mediated sustained activation of Src under anoikis conditions. Furthermore, such sustained Src activation confers anoikis resistance at least in part through a consequent sustenance of Fak-Src interactions and MEK/Erk activation, thus not only overriding Fak-mediated signaling to MEK/Erk and/or PI3-K/Akt-1, but also the requirement of Fak and/or PI3-K/Akt-1 for survival.},

Id proteins have previously been reported to inhibit major features of TGF-beta-induced EMT. In this study, we show that expression of the deltaEF1 family proteins, deltaEF1 (ZEB1) and SIP1, is gradually increased by TGF-beta with expression profiles reciprocal to that of E-cadherin. SIP1 and deltaEF1 each dramatically down-regulated the transcription of E-cadherin in NMuMG cells through direct binding to the E-cadherin promoter. Silencing of the expression of both SIP1 and deltaEF1, but not either alone, completely abolished TGF-beta-induced E-cadherin repression. However, expression of mesenchymal markers, including Fibronectin, N-cadherin, and vimentin, was not affected by knockdown of SIP1 and deltaEF1. TGF-beta-induced the expression of Ets1, which in turn activated deltaEF1 promoter activity. Moreover, up-regulation of SIP1 and deltaEF1 expression by TGF-beta was suppressed by knockdown of Ets1 expression. In addition, Id2 suppressed the TGF-beta- and Ets1-induced up-regulation of deltaEF1. Taken together, these findings suggest that the deltaEF1 family proteins, SIP1 and deltaEF1, are necessary, but not sufficient, for TGF-beta-induced EMT and that Ets1 induced by TGF-beta may function as an upstream transcriptional regulator of SIP1 and deltaEF1.},

  abstract = {Notch signaling pathway mediates cell-fate determination during embryonic development, wound healing, and tumorigenesis. This pathway is activated when the ligand Delta or the ligand Jagged of one cell interacts with the Notch receptor of its neighboring cell, releasing the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) that activates many downstream target genes. NICD affects ligand production asymmetrically--it represses Delta, but activates Jagged. Although the dynamical role of Notch-Jagged signaling remains elusive, it is widely recognized that Notch-Delta signaling behaves as an intercellular toggle switch, giving rise to two distinct fates that neighboring cells adopt--Sender (high ligand, low receptor) and Receiver (low ligand, high receptor). Here, we devise a specific theoretical framework that incorporates both Delta and Jagged in Notch signaling circuit to explore the functional role of Jagged in cell-fate determination. We find that the asymmetric effect of NICD renders the circuit to behave as a three-way switch, giving rise to an additional state--a hybrid Sender/Receiver (medium ligand, medium receptor). This phenotype allows neighboring cells to both send and receive signals, thereby attaining similar fates. We also show that due to the asymmetric effect of the glycosyltransferase Fringe, different outcomes are generated depending on which ligand is dominant: Delta-mediated signaling drives neighboring cells to have an opposite fate; Jagged-mediated signaling drives the cell to maintain a similar fate to that of its neighbor. We elucidate the role of Jagged in cell-fate determination and discuss its possible implications in understanding tumor-stroma cross-talk, which frequently entails Notch-Jagged communication.},

Overexpression of dominant-negative forms of Smad3 abrogate these TGFbeta-induced responses. We also demonstrate that TGFbeta induces Bim protein expression concomitant with its induction of apoptosis in the mouse progenitor B lymphocyte cell line, Ba/F3. Enhanced expression of Bim protein induced by TGFbeta is associated with an increased association of Bim with Bcl-2 and a concomitant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, we find that the anti-apoptotic effect of the pro-survival cytokine CD40 results in the abrogation of TGFbeta-mediated Bim induction. Our data provide the first evidence of Bim expression levels that are increased by the addition of a pro-apoptotic cytokine, TGFbeta, and also suggest that the TGFbeta-specific transcription factor Smad3 plays a role in mediating Bim expression levels and apoptosis.},

Mutating the Cyclin binding sites or the three conserved phosphorylation sites abrogates the ability of the N terminus of Bora to promote Plk1 activation. In human cells, Bora-carrying mutations of the three conserved phosphorylation sites cannot sustain mitotic entry after DNA damage. In C. elegans embryos, mutation of the three conserved phosphorylation sites in SPAT-1, the Bora ortholog, results in a severe mitotic entry delay.

ZEB1 is also expressed in UM and high expression of ZEB1 correlates with UM advancement, but has little effect on cell morphology. We show that spindle UM cells can become epithelioid but not vice versa; and ZEB1 exerts its tumorigenic effects by promoting cell dedifferentiation, proliferation, invasiveness, and dissemination. We provide evidence that ZEB1 binds not only to repress critical genes involving in pigment synthesis, mitosis, adherent junctions, but also to transactivate genes involving in matrix degradation and cellular locomotion to propel UM progression towards metastasis. We conclude that ZEB1 is a major oncogenic factor required for UM progression and could be a potential therapeutic target for treating UM in the clinic.},

HMGA2 associates with Smad complexes and induces expression of an established regulator of EMT, the zinc finger transcription factor Snail. We now show that HMGA2 can also induce expression of a second regulator of EMT, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist. Silencing of endogenous Twist demonstrated that this protein acts in a partially redundant manner together with Snail. Double silencing of Snail and Twist reverts mesenchymal HMGA2-expressing cells to a more epithelial phenotype when compared with single silencing of Snail or Twist. Furthermore, HMGA2 can directly associate with A:T-rich sequences and promote transcription from the Twist promoter. The new evidence proposes a model whereby HMGA2 directly induces multiple transcriptional regulators of the EMT program and, thus, is a potential biomarker for carcinomas displaying EMT during progression to more advanced stages of malignancy.},

Here, we present evidence that IQGAP1 stimulates branched actin filament assembly, which provides the force for lamellipodial protrusion, and that this function of IQGAP1 is regulated by binding of type 2 fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) to a cognate receptor, FGFR1. Stimulation of serum-starved MDBK cells with FGF2 promoted IQGAP1-dependent lamellipodial protrusion and cell migration, and intracellular associations of IQGAP1 with FGFR1 \textendash{} and two other factors \textendash{} the Arp2/3 complex and its activator N-WASP, that coordinately promote nucleation of branched actin filament networks. FGF2 also induced recruitment of IQGAP1, FGFR1, N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex to lamellipodia. N-WASP was also required for FGF2-stimulated migration of MDBK cells. In vitro, IQGAP1 bound directly to the cytoplasmic tail of FGFR1 and to N-WASP, and stimulated branched actin filament nucleation in the presence of N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex. Based on these observations, we conclude that IQGAP1 links FGF2 signaling to Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin assembly by serving as a binding partner for FGFR1 and as an activator of N-WASP.},

This fractional killing arises not from mutation but from preexisting, stochastic differences in the levels and activities of proteins regulating apoptosis. Here we examine the properties of cells that survive treatment with agonists of two distinct death receptors, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and anti-FasR antibodies. We find that "survivor" cells are highly resistant to a second ligand dose applied 1 d later. Resistance is reversible, resetting after several days of culture in the absence of death ligand. "Reset" cells appear identical to drug-naive cells with respect to death ligand sensitivity and gene expression profiles. TRAIL survivors are cross-resistant to activators of FasR and vice versa and exhibit an NF-{$\kappa$}B-dependent inflammatory phenotype. Remarkably, reversible resistance is induced in the absence of cell death when caspase inhibitors are present and can be sustained for 1 wk or more, also without cell death, by periodic ligand exposure. Thus stochastic differences in cell state can have sustained consequences for sen-sitivity to prodeath ligands and acquisition of proinflammatory phenotypes. The important role played by periodicity in TRAIL exposure for induction of opposing apoptosis and survival mechanisms has implications for the design of optimal therapeutic agents and protocols.},

In support of this mechanism, analysis of cells at a point before cell cycle entry (i.e., before the G1/S transition) revealed a p21-CDK2 axis that determines quiescent and cycling cell states.

Using this framework to analyze transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, we find that cells use different timing activity motifs to optimize transcription timing in response to changing conditions: forward activation to produce metabolic compounds efficiently, backward shutoff to rapidly stop production of a detrimental product and synchronized activation for co-production of metabolites required for the same reaction. Measuring protein abundance over a time course reveals that mRNA timing motifs also occur at the protein level. Timing motifs significantly overlap with binding activity motifs, where genes in a linear chain have ordered binding affinity to a transcription factor, suggesting a mechanism for ordered transcription. Finely timed transcriptional regulation is therefore abundant in yeast metabolism, optimizing the organism's adaptation to new environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell cancer that is caused by several chromosomal translocations and gene deletions. Although deregulation of several signaling pathways including the Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) pathway has been reported in MM, the molecular requirement and the crosstalk between NF-{$\kappa$}B and its target genes in MM cell survival has been largely unclear. Here, we report that Yin Yang1 (YY1), a target gene for NF-{$\kappa$}B, is hyperexpressed in most MM tumor cells obtained from human patients, exhibits constitutive nuclear localization, and is essential for survival of MM cells. Mechanistically, we report a novel YY1-RelA complex formation, which is essential to transcriptionally repress a proapoptotic gene Bim. In line with this, depletion of YY1 or RelA resulted in elevated levels of Bim and apoptosis. Moreover, both YY1 and RelA are recruited to the Bim promoter and are required to repress the Bim promoter. Importantly, depletion of YY1 or RelA almost completely impaired the colony forming ability of MM progenitor cells suggesting that both RelA and YY1 are essential for the survival and growth of MM progenitor cells. Moreover, depletion of either YY1 or RelA completely inhibited MM tumor growth in xenograft models for human myeloma. Thus, a novel RelA-YY1 transcriptional repression complex is an attractive drug target in MM.},

Recent studies emphasize that WPBs provide a dynamic storage compartment whose contents can be regulated depending on the presence of inflammatory mediators in the vascular micro-environment. Additionally, release of WPBs is tightly regulated and feedback mechanisms have been identified that prevent excessive release of bioactive components from this subcellular organelle. The ability to regulate both contents and exocytosis of WPBs endows these endothelial cell specific organelles with a remarkable plasticity. This is most likely needed to allow for controlled delivery of bioactive components into the circulation on vascular perturbation.},

Rac is implicated in apoptosis, but little is known about the mechanism by which it responds to apoptotic stimuli. Here we demonstrate that endogenous Rac GTPases are caspase 3 substrates that are cleaved in human lymphoma cells during drug-induced apoptosis. Cleavage of Rac1 occurs at two unconventional caspase 3 sites, VVGD11/G and VMVD47/G, and results in inactivation of the GTPase and effector functions of the protein (binding to the p21-activated protein kinase PAK1). Expression of caspase 3-resistant Rac1 mutants in the cells suppresses drug-induced apoptosis. Thus, proteolytic inactivation of Rac GTPases represents a novel, irreversible mechanism of Rac downregulation that allows maximal cell death following drug treatment.},

The biological stationary state, the G1 state, is a global attractor of the dynamics. The biological pathway, the cell-cycle sequence of protein states, is a globally attracting trajectory of the dynamics. These properties are largely preserved with respect to small perturbations to the network. These results suggest that cellular regulatory networks are robustly designed for their functions.},

To interfere with Src function in vitro and in vivo many studies have employed the pharmacologic Src inhibitors PP2 and PP1. Both agents have recently been shown to be powerful inhibitors of TGF-\ss{} receptor type I/ALK5 and type II. As this situation prohibited any definite conclusions with respect to the relative contribution of TGF-\ss{} vs. Src signaling, we decided to reappraise a potential role of Src in TGF-\ss 1-mediated cellular responses using RNA and dominant-negative (dn) interference to block Src expression and function, respectively. In TGF-\ss -responsive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, we show that Src is activated by TGF-\ss 1 and that its specific inhibition strongly attenuated basal proliferation and enhanced TGF-\ss 1-mediated growth arrest. However, Src inhibition was unable to impair TGF-\ss 1-controlled EMT as evidenced by cell morphology and regulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Despite its dispensibility for TGF-\ss -induced EMT, specific inhibition of Src dramatically reduced basal and TGF-\ss 1-induced cell migration in Panc-1 cells as measured with a novel real-time migration assay (xCELLigence DP system). Biochemically, dnSrc inhibition failed to block TGF-\ss 1/ALK5-induced activation of Smad2 and Smad3, but partially inhibited transcriptional activation of TGF-\ss/Smad-responsive reporter genes, and effectively blocked basal and TGF-\ss 1-induced activation of p38 MAPK. Together, the data provide evidence for a role of Src in the regulation of basal proliferation as well as in basal and TGF-\ss 1-mediated cell motility but not EMT in TGF-\ss -responsive pancreatic (tumor) cells.},

Structurally, the BBB is formed by tight junctions between the endothelial cells. Astrocytes, pericytes and perivascular microglia surround the endothelial cells contributing to proper functioning of the BBB. Hypoxia, associated with disorders such as stroke, cardiac arrest, respiratory distress, carbon monoxide poisoning among many others, disrupts the BBB. Alterations in the endothelial cells such as increased pinocytotic vesicles and derangement of the tight junction proteins may be responsible for increased permeability at the BBB resulting in swelling of astrocyte end feet. The disruption of BBB in hypoxic conditions is multifactorial and may involve factors such as enhanced production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nitric oxide (NO) and inflammatory cytokines. Although future research is needed to look into possible therapeutic strategies to improve the functioning of BBB in hypoxic conditions, experimental studies so far have reported beneficial effect of curcumin, melatonin, simvastatin and minocycline in ameliorating the increased BBB permeability in hypoxic conditions.},

Numerous mutations of Merlin have been identified in Neurofibromatosis type 2 and other cancer patients. Despite more than two decades of research, the upstream regulator of Merlin in the Hippo pathway remains unknown. Here we show by high-resolution crystal structures that the Lats1/2-binding site on the Merlin FERM domain is physically blocked by Merlin's auto-inhibitory tail. Angiomotin binding releases the auto-inhibition and promotes Merlin's binding to Lats1/2. Phosphorylation of Ser518 outside the Merlin's auto-inhibitory tail does not obviously alter Merlin's conformation, but instead prevents angiomotin from binding and thus inhibits Hippo pathway kinase activation. Cancer-causing mutations clustered in the angiomotin-binding domain impair angiomotin-mediated Merlin activation. Our findings reveal that angiomotin and Merlin respectively interface cortical actin filaments and core kinases in Hippo signaling, and allow construction of a complete Hippo signaling pathway.},

Through computational studies, we show that it is generally difficult to adjust a negative feedback oscillator's frequency without compromising its amplitude, whereas with positive-plus-negative feedback, one can achieve a widely tunable frequency and near-constant amplitude. This tunability makes the latter design suitable for biological rhythms like heartbeats and cell cycles that need to provide a constant output over a range of frequencies. Positive-plus-negative oscillators also appear to be more robust and easier to evolve, rationalizing why they are found in contexts where an adjustable frequency is unimportant.},

Despite this, little is known about the relative level of expression and regulation of this hemostatic factor in ECs in different vascular beds in vivo. In the present study, we used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization analysis to study vWF gene expression in murine tissues. Large differences in the level of vWF mRNA were observed when comparing highly vascularized tissues, with the lung and brain containing 5 to 50 times higher concentrations of vWF mRNA than the kidney and liver. In this regard, ECs of small vessels and some microvessels in the lung and brain expressed abundant vWF mRNA, whereas ECs of similar sized vessels in the liver and kidney expressed relatively low levels. In general, significantly higher levels of vWF mRNA and antigen were demonstrated in ECs of larger vessels compared with microvessels and in venous ECs compared with arterial ECs. Although intraperitoneal administration of endotoxin (or tumor necrosis factor-alpha) increased plasma vWF levels, it had variable effects on the steady-state level of vWF mRNA in murine tissues (ie, it decreased vWF mRNA in many tissues, increased it in others, and had little effect on still others). These results indicate that vWF is differentially expressed and regulated in ECs present in different tissues and within the same vascular bed.},

However, the functions and mechanisms in endothelial cells (ECs) have not been examined. Herein, we investigate the role of Hsp70s, including heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70), which is constitutively expressed in nonstressed cells (ie, ECs). METHODS AND RESULTS: The Hsp70 inhibitor, KNK437, significantly decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced cell migration and tube formation in vitro. KNK437 inhibited the phosphorylation of VEGF-induced Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In a mouse hind limb model of vascular insufficiency, intramuscular inhibition of Hsp70s attenuated collateral and capillary vessel formation. Silencing the Hsc70 gene by short interfering RNA abolished VEGF-induced Akt phosphorylation and VEGF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration and tube formation. As the molecular mechanisms, Hsc70 knockdown reduced the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, Hsc70 plays a significant role in ECs via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Hsc70 may provide the basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies for angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in the tumor metastatic cascade, is characterized by the loss of cell-cell junctions and cell polarity, as well as the acquisition of migratory and invasive properties. LEF-1 is a member of the lymphoid enhancer-binding factor/T-cell factor (LEF/TCF) family of DNA-binding transcription factors, which interact with nuclear {$\beta$}-catenin and act as central transcriptional mediators of Wnt signaling. To investigate the role of LEF-1 in EMT, we generated stable LEF-1 transfectants using MDCK cells. The transfectants had a spindle-shaped mesenchymal morphology, and enhanced migration and invasiveness relative to control cells. These EMT changes were accompanied by the downregulation of an epithelial marker protein, E-cadherin, and the upregulation of mesenchymal marker proteins, vimentin and N-cadherin. Consistent with these observations, the mRNA levels of Slug, ZEB1, and ZEB2-EMT-related transcription factors-increased significantly. Although the N-terminally deleted mutant LEF-1 cannot interact with {$\beta$}-catenin, it retained the ability to induce EMT. Consistent with these observations, neither the expression of a dominant negative {$\beta$}-catenin/engrailed chimera, nor the expression of a cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin that sequesters {$\beta$}-catenin from binding to LEF/TCF, reversed LEF-1-induced EMT. Together, these data indicated that the nuclear function of {$\beta$}-catenin was not necessary for the induction of Slug, ZEB1, and ZEB2 expression leading to EMT.},

Yet within each group of fate-changing transcription factors, a subset called `pioneer factors' are dominant in their ability to engage silent, unmarked chromatin and initiate the recruitment of other factors, thereby imparting new function to regulatory DNA sequences. Recent studies have shown that pioneer factors are also crucial for cellular reprogramming and that they are implicated in the marked changes in gene regulatory networks that occur in various cancers. Here, we provide an overview of the contexts in which pioneer factors function, how they can target silent genes, and their limitations at regions of heterochromatin. Understanding how pioneer factors regulate gene expression greatly enhances our understanding of how specific developmental lineages are established as well as how cell fates can be manipulated.},

Reciprocal signaling interactions between the foregut epithelium and its associated mesenchyme guide development of the respiratory endoderm, from a naive sheet of cells to multiple cell types that line a functional organ. This review synthesizes current understanding of the early events in respiratory system development, focusing on three main topics: (1) specification of the respiratory system as a distinct organ of the endoderm, (2) patterning and differentiation of the nascent respiratory epithelium along its proximal-distal axis, and (3) plasticity of the respiratory cells during the process of development. This review also highlights areas in need of further study, including determining how early endoderm cells rapidly switch their responses to the same signaling cues during development, and how the general proximal-distal pattern of the lung is converted to fine-scale organization of multiple cell types along this axis.},

This plasticity poses a major clinical challenge for treating metastasis, while its underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Transitions between these phenotypes are mediated by the Rac1/RhoA circuit that responds to external signals such as HGF/SF via c-MET pathway. Using detailed modeling of GTPase-based regulation to study the Rac1/RhoA circuit's dynamics, we found that it can operate as a three-way switch. We propose to associate the circuit's three possible states to the amoeboid, mesenchymal and amoeboid/mesenchymal hybrid phenotype. In particular, we investigated the range of existence of, and the transition between, the three states (phenotypes) in response to Grb2 and Gab1 - two downstream adaptors of c-MET. The results help to explain the regulation of metastatic cells by c-MET pathway and hence can contribute to the assessment of possible clinical interventions.},

Individuals associate in groups in which benefits are shared and costs borne individually; each individual is either a generalist who can perform all the necessary tasks, a specialist who performs a sub-set of the necessary tasks, or a parasite who contributes nothing to the group. The implications of the model are explored analytically and through both numerical and Monte Carlo methods. These methods demonstrate the evolution of populations towards stable arrangements of specialists and generalists. The fittest populations are those that divide tasks fairly and associate in large, highly specialized groups. Generalists have a distinct advantage in small groups, but the presence of generalists, ironically, lowers group fitness. Parasites are able to invade both specialized and non-specialized populations. A basic model for the continuous division of labour is also presented, demonstrating a tendency for populations to evolve increasingly unfair divisions of labour. This last result implies that an evolutionary ratchet favours disparity between the workload of specialist populations.},

These findings were extended to primary ovarian cancer specimens. miR-200 was found to directly target the mRNA of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (TCF8/deltaEF1) and ZEB2 (SMAD-interacting protein 1 [SIP1]/ZFXH1B). Ectopic expression of miR-200 caused up-regulation of E-cadherin in cancer cell lines and reduced their motility. Conversely, inhibition of miR-200 reduced E-cadherin expression, increased expression of Vimentin, and induced EMT.

Here we report that TSC2 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) toward Rheb, a Ras family GTPase. Rheb stimulates phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1. This function of Rheb is blocked by rapamycin and dominant-negative mTOR. Rheb stimulates the phosphorylation of mTOR and plays an essential role in regulation of S6K and 4EBP1 in response to nutrients and cellular energy status.

Boolean or logical modeling has become a promising approach to capture the qualitative behavior of such complex networks. Here we built a large-scale literature-based Boolean model of the central intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways as well as pathways connected with them. The model responds to several external stimuli such as Fas ligand, TNF-alpha, UV-B irradiation, interleukin-1beta and insulin. Timescales and multi-value node logic were used and turned out to be indispensable to reproduce the behavior of the apoptotic network. The coherence of the model was experimentally validated. Thereby an UV-B dose-effect is shown for the first time in mouse hepatocytes. Analysis of the model revealed a tight regulation emerging from high connectivity and spanning crosstalks and a particular importance of feedback loops. An unexpected feedback from Smac release to RIP could further increase complex II formation. The introduced Boolean model provides a comprehensive and coherent description of the apoptosis network behavior. It gives new insights into the complex interplay of pro- and antiapoptotic factors and can be easily expanded to other signaling pathways.},

  abstract = {The activities of cyclin D-dependent kinases serve to integrate extracellular signaling during G1 phase with the cell-cycle engine that regulates DNA replication and mitosis. Induction of D-type cyclins and their assembly into holoenzyme complexes depend on mitogen stimulation. Conversely, the fact that D-type cyclins are labile proteins guarantees that the subunit pool shrinks rapidly when cells are deprived of mitogens. Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on a single threonine residue near the carboxyl terminus (Thr-286) positively regulates proteasomal degradation of D1. Now, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylates cyclin D1 specifically on Thr-286, thereby triggering rapid cyclin D1 turnover. Because the activity of GSK-3beta can be inhibited by signaling through a pathway that sequentially involves Ras, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt), the turnover of cyclin D1, like its assembly, is also Ras dependent and, hence, mitogen regulated. In contrast, Ras mutants defective in PI3K signaling, or constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase (MEK1) mutants that act downstream of Ras to activate extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), cannot stabilize cyclin D1. In direct contrast to cyclin D1, which accumulates in the nucleus during G1 phase and exits into the cytoplasm during S phase, GSK-3beta is predominantly cytoplasmic during G1 phase, but a significant fraction enters the nucleus during S phase. A highly stable D1 mutant in which an alanine is substituted for the threonine at position 286 and that is refractory to phosphorylation by GSK-3beta remained in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. Overexpression of an active, but not a kinase-defective, form of GSK-3beta in mouse fibroblasts caused a redistribution of cyclin D1 from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. Therefore, phosphorylation and proteolytic turnover of cyclin D1 and its subcellular localization during the cell division cycle are linked through the action of GSK-3beta.},

  abstract = {In most regions of the brain, the uptake of glutamate and other anionic excitatory amino acids from the circulation is limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In most animals, the BBB is formed by the brain vascular endothelium, which contains cells that are joined by multiple bands of tight junctions. These junctions effectively close off diffusion through intercellular pores; as a result, most solutes cross the BBB either by diffusing across the lipoid endothelial cell membranes or by being transported across by specific carriers. Glutamate transport at the BBB has been studied by both in vitro cell uptake assays and in vivo perfusion methods. The results demonstrate that at physiologic plasma concentrations, glutamate flux from plasma into brain is mediated by a high affinity transport system at the BBB. Efflux from brain back into plasma appears to be driven in large part by a sodium-dependent active transport system at the capillary abluminal membrane. Glutamate concentration in brain interstitial fluid is only a fraction of that of plasma and is maintained fairly independently of small fluctuations in plasma concentration. Restricted brain passage is also observed for several excitatory glutamate analogs, including domoic acid and kynurenic acid. In summary, the BBB is one component of a regulatory system that helps maintain brain interstitial fluid glutamate concentration independently of the circulation.},

We found that the protein molecules are produced in bursts, with each burst originating from a stochastically transcribed single messenger RNA molecule, and that protein copy numbers in the bursts follow a geometric distribution. The quantitative study of low-level gene expression demonstrates the potential of single-molecule experiments in elucidating the workings of fundamental biological processes in living cells.},

  abstract = {Cells often mount ultrasensitive (switch-like) responses to stimuli. The design principles underlying many switches are not known. We computationally studied the switching behavior of GTPases, and found that this first-order kinetic system can show ultrasensitivity. Analytical solutions indicate that ultrasensitive first-order reactions can yield switches that respond to signal amplitude or duration. The three-component GTPase system is analogous to the physical fermion gas. This analogy allows for an analytical understanding of the functional capabilities of first-order ultrasensitive systems. Experiments show amplitude- and time-dependent Rap GTPase switching in response to Cannabinoid-1 receptor signal. This first-order switch arises from relative reaction rates and the concentrations ratios of the activator and deactivator of Rap. First-order ultrasensitivity is applicable to many systems where threshold for transition between states is dependent on the duration, amplitude, or location of a distal signal. We conclude that the emergence of ultrasensitivity from coupled first-order reactions provides a versatile mechanism for the design of biochemical switches.},

Combined cell lysates were affinity-purified over the SH2 domain of the adapter protein Grb2 (GST-SH2 fusion protein) that specifically binds phosphorylated EGFR and Src homologous and collagen (Shc) protein. We identified 228 proteins, of which 28 were selectively enriched upon stimulation. EGFR and Shc, which interact directly with the bait, had large differential ratios. Many signaling molecules specifically formed complexes with the activated EGFR-Shc, as did plectin, epiplakin, cytokeratin networks, histone H3, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecule CD59, and two novel proteins. SILAC combined with modification-based affinity purification is a useful approach to detect specific and functional protein-protein interactions.},

Akt plays a key role in the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, but little is known about its involvement in tumorigenesis. Here we examined the functional roles of the Akt/beta-catenin pathway in UCSs. In clinical samples, phospho-Akt (pAkt) expression was found to be significantly increased in mesenchymal compared with epithelial components, exhibiting both positive and negative correlations with nuclear beta-catenin and E-cadherin, respectively. Expression levels of the transcription factor Slug were also significantly up-regulated in the mesenchymal components and strongly correlated with both pAkt and nuclear beta-catenin. In endometrial cancer cell lines, active Akt induced the stabilization of nuclear beta-catenin through the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, and this, in turn, led to the transactivation of Slug, which was mediated by nuclear beta-catenin. Moreover, Slug overexpression itself caused repression of E-cadherin, with subtle changes in cell morphology. In addition, knockdown of the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) up-regulated pAkt and repressed E-cadherin, consistent with the in vivo finding of significantly decreased Rb expression in mesenchymal components. These findings suggest that changes in the Akt/beta-catenin pathway, as well as alterations in Rb expression, may be essential for both the establishment and maintenance of phenotypic characteristics of UCSs, playing key roles in the regulation of E-cadherin through the transactivation of the Slug gene.},

Recently chitosan and chitosan analogs have also been shown to support the growth and continued function of chondrocytes. In the present study, chitosan substrates are crosslinked with a functional diepoxide (1,4 butanediol diglycidyl ether) to alter its mechanical property, and the viability and proliferation of the canine articular chondrocytes seeded on the crosslinked surface are further assayed. Of interest is the impact of substrate stiffness on the growth and proliferation of articular canine chondrocytes. Crosslinked scaffolds were also subjected to degradation by chitosanase to examine the impact of crosslinking on enzyme-assisted degradation. The hydrophilicity and compression modulus of the crosslinked surfaces were measured via contact-angle measurements and compression tests, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescent staining were used to observe the proliferation and morphology of chondrocyte cells on noncrosslinked and crosslinked surfaces. The crosslinked chitosan was found to be nontoxic to chondrocytes and more hydrophilic. Its compression modulus and stiffness increased, which may improve the scaffold resistance to wear and in vivo shrinkage once implanted. The increased stiffness also seemed to serve as an additional mechanical stimulus to promote chondrocyte growth and proliferation. The cell morphology on crosslinked scaffolds seen by SEM and fluorescent stain was the typical chondrocytic rounded shape. The method proposed provides a nontoxic way to increase the mechanical strength of the chitosan scaffolds.},

Whether, and how, cells make use of the coexistence of a larger number of stable states (multistability) is however largely unknown. Here, we first examine how autoregulation, a common attribute of genetic master regulators, facilitates multistability in two-component circuits. A systematic exploration of these modules' parameter space reveals two classes of molecular switches, involving transitions in bistable (progression switches) or multistable (decision switches) regimes. We demonstrate the potential of decision switches for multifaceted stimulus processing, including strength, duration, and flexible discrimination. These tasks enhance response specificity, help to store short-term memories of recent signaling events, stabilize transient gene expression, and enable stochastic fate commitment. The relevance of these circuits is further supported by biological data, because we find them in numerous developmental scenarios. Indeed, many of the presented information-processing features of decision switches could ultimately demonstrate a more flexible control of epigenetic differentiation.},

Both the major autophosphorylation site (Y397) and a site critical to the kinase activity (K454) of FAK were required for this effect. Activated FAK also transformed MDCK cells, by the criteria of anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in nude mice. We provide evidence that this transformation resulted primarily from the cells' resistance to anoikis rather than from the activation of growth factor response pathways. These results indicate that FAK can regulate anoikis and that the conferral of anoikis resistance may suffice to transform certain epithelial cells.},

PLK1, at least in Xenopus, starts the mitotic cascade by phosphorylating and activating cdc25C phosphatase. Also, loss of PLK1 function has been shown to induce mitotic catastrophe in a HeLa cervical carcinoma cell line but not in normal Hs68 fibroblasts. We wanted to understand whether the selective mitotic catastrophe in HeLa cells could be extended to other tumor types, and, if so, whether it could be attributable to a tumor-specific loss of dependence on PLK1 for cdc25C activation. When PLK1 function was blocked through adenovirus delivery of a dominant-negative gene, we observed tumor-selective apoptosis in most tumor cell lines. In some lines, dominant-negative PLK1 induced a mitotic catastrophe similar to that published in HeLa cells (K. E. Mundt et al., Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun., 239: 377-385, 1997). Normal human mammary epithelial cells, although arrested in mitosis, appeared to escape the loss of centrosome maturation and mitotic catastrophe seen in tumor lines. Mitotic phosphorylation of cdc25C and activation of cdk1 was blocked by dominant-negative PLK1 in human mammary epithelial cells as well as in the tumor lines regardless of whether they underwent mitotic catastrophe. These data strongly argue that the mitotic catastrophe is not attributable to a lack of dependence for PLK1 in activating cdc25C.},

These forces activate a wide range of signaling pathways and genetic programs to control cell survival, fate, and behavior. Additionally, cells sense the physical properties of their surrounding environment through forces exerted on integrin-mediated adhesions.

We investigated the status of FAK phosphorylation and cleavage in renal epithelial cells during apoptosis caused by the nephrotoxicant dichlorovinylcysteine (DCVC). DCVC treatment caused a loss of cell-matrix contact which was preceded by a dissociation of FAK from the focal adhesions and tyrosine dephosphorylation of FAK. Paxillin was also dephosphorylated at tyrosine. DCVC treatment activated caspase-3 which was associated with cleavage of FAK. However, FAK cleavage occurred after cells had already lost focal adhesions indicating that cleavage of FAK by caspases is not responsible for loss of FAK from focal adhesions. Accordingly, although inhibition of caspase activity with zVAD-fmk blocked activation of caspase-3, FAK cleavage, and apoptosis, it neither affected dephosphorylation nor translocation of FAK or paxillin. However, zVAD-fmk completely blocked the cell detachment caused by DCVC treatment. Orthovanadate prevented DCVC-induced tyrosine dephosphorylation of both FAK and paxillin; however, it did not inhibit DCVC-induced apoptosis and actually potentiated focal adhesion disorganization and cell detachment. Thus, FAK dephosphorylation and loss of focal adhesions are not due to caspase activation; however, caspases are required for FAK proteolysis and cell detachment.},

  abstract = {Formation of cerebral oedema caused by vascular leakage is a major problem in various injuries of the CNS, such as stroke, head injury and high-altitude illness. A common feature of all these disorders is the fact that they are associated with tissue hypoxia. Hypoxia has therefore been suggested to be an important pathogenic factor for the induction of vascular leakage in the brain. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known as the major inducer of angiogenesis. Originally, however, it was described as a vascular permeability factor. As VEGF gene expression was shown to be upregulated by hypoxia, increased VEGF expression may link hypoxia and vascular leakage in the CNS in vivo. To delineate the role of VEGF in vascular leakage in the brain, we studied the effect of hypoxia on VEGF expression and vascular permeability in the brains of mice in vivo. Hypoxic exposure led to a significant increase in the levels of VEGF mRNA and protein in mouse brain that correlated with the severity of the hypoxic stimulus. Measurement of vascular permeability using the fluorescent marker sodium fluorescein revealed a two-fold increase in fluorescence intensity in hypoxic brains, indicative of significant vascular leakage. Inhibition of VEGF activity by a neutralizing antibody completely blocked the hypoxia-induced increase in vascular permeability. In conclusion, our data show that VEGF is responsible for hypoxia-induced augmentation in vascular leakage following tissue hypoxia. Our findings might provide the basis for new therapeutic concepts for the treatment of cerebral oedema.},

These stochastic events of protein production are difficult to observe directly with measurements on large ensembles of cells owing to lack of synchronization among cells. Measurements so far on single cells lack the sensitivity to resolve individual events of protein production. Here we demonstrate a microfluidic-based assay that allows real-time observation of the expression of beta-galactosidase in living Escherichia coli cells with single molecule sensitivity. We observe that protein production occurs in bursts, with the number of molecules per burst following an exponential distribution. We show that the two key parameters of protein expression--the burst size and frequency--can be either determined directly from real-time monitoring of protein production or extracted from a measurement of the steady-state copy number distribution in a population of cells. Application of this assay to probe gene expression in individual budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrates its generality. Many important proteins are expressed at low levels, and are thus inaccessible by current genomic and proteomic techniques. This microfluidic single cell assay opens up possibilities for system-wide characterization of the expression of these low copy number proteins.},

We raised phospho-specific antibodies against cyclin B1 that primarily recognise the active form of the complex. We show that cyclin B1 is initially phosphorylated on centrosomes in prophase and that Plk1 phosphorylates cyclin B1, but not in the NES. Furthermore, phosphorylation by Plk1 does not cause cyclin B1 to move into the nucleus.

In this study, we show that inhibition of Plk1 impairs DNA replication and results in slow S-phase progression in cultured cancer cells. We have identified origin recognition complex 2 (Orc2), a member of the DNA replication machinery, as a Plk1 substrate and have shown that Plk1 phosphorylates Orc2 at Ser188 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Orc2-S188 phosphorylation is enhanced when DNA replication is under challenge induced by ultraviolet, hydroxyurea, gemcitabine, or aphidicolin treatment. Cells expressing the unphosphorylatable mutant (S188A) of Orc2 had defects in DNA synthesis under stress, suggesting that this phosphorylation event is critical to maintain DNA replication under stress. To dissect the mechanism pertinent to this observation, we showed that Orc2-S188 phosphorylation associates with DNA replication origin and that cells expressing Orc2-S188A mutant fail to maintain the functional pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) under DNA replication stress. Furthermore, the intra-S-phase checkpoint is activated in Orc2-S188A-expressing cells to cause delay of S-phase progress. Our study suggests a novel role of Plk1 in facilitating DNA replication under conditions of stress to maintain genomic integrity.},

Here we explore theoretically the potentials and limitations of combinatorial signal integration at the level of cis-regulatory transcription control. Our analysis suggests that many complex transcription-control functions of the type encountered in higher eukaryotes are already implementable within the much simpler bacterial transcription system. Using a quantitative model of bacterial transcription and invoking only specific protein-DNA interaction and weak glue-like interaction between regulatory proteins, we show explicit schemes to implement regulatory logic functions of increasing complexity by appropriately selecting the strengths and arranging the relative positions of the relevant protein-binding DNA sequences in the cis-regulatory region. The architectures that emerge are naturally modular and evolvable. Our results suggest that the transcription regulatory apparatus is a "programmable" computing machine, belonging formally to the class of Boltzmann machines. Crucial to our results is the ability to regulate gene expression at a distance. In bacteria, this can be achieved for isolated genes via DNA looping controlled by the dimerization of DNA-bound proteins. However, if adopted extensively in the genome, long-distance interaction can cause unintentional intergenic cross talk, a detrimental side effect difficult to overcome by the known bacterial transcription-regulation systems. This may be a key factor limiting the genome-wide adoption of complex transcription control in bacteria. Implications of our findings for combinatorial transcription control in eukaryotes are discussed.},

Induction of selectin ligands on T cells is controlled primarily by cytokines, including TGF-{$\beta$}1, and requires p38{$\alpha$} MAPK, but transcriptional mechanisms that underlie cytokine-driven selectin ligand expression are poorly understood. In this study, we show, using mice with conditional deletions of the TGF-{$\beta$}1-responsive transcription factors Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4, that induction of selectin ligands on CD4 cells in response to TGF-{$\beta$}1 requires Smad4 plus either Smad2 or Smad3. Analysis of CD4 cells from mice with only one functional Smad4 allele revealed a sharp gene dosage effect, suggesting the existence of a threshold of TGF-{$\beta$}1 signal strength required for selectin ligand induction. Both Smad4 plus either Smad2 or Smad3 were selectively required for induction of Fut7 and Gcnt1, glycosyltransferases critical for selectin ligand biosynthesis, but they were not required for St3gal4 or St3gal6 induction. Smad4 plus either Smad2 or Smad3 were also required for induction of Runx transcription factors by TGF-{$\beta$}1. Enforced expression of Runx2, but not Runx1 or Runx3, in Smad2/Smad3 doubly deficient CD4 cells restored selectin ligand expression to wild-type levels. In contrast, enforced expression of Runx1, Runx2, or Runx3 failed to restore differentiation of TGF-{$\beta$}1-dependent Th cell lineages, including Th17, Th9, and induced regulatory T cells. These results show that Smads are directly required for Th cell differentiation independent of Runx induction but only indirectly required via Runx2 for TGF-{$\beta$}1-induced selectin ligand induction on murine CD4 T cells.},

Rad24 is a 14-3-3 protein that is important in the DNA-damage checkpoint in fission yeast. Here we show that Rad24 controls the intracellular distribution of Cdc25. Elimination of Rad24 causes nuclear accumulation of Cdc25. Activation of the DNA-damage checkpoint causes the net nuclear export of Cdc25 by a process that requires Chk1, Rad24 and nuclear-export machinery. Mutation of a putative nuclear-export signal in Rad24 impairs the nuclear exclusion of Rad24, the damage-induced nuclear export of Cdc25 and the damage checkpoint. Thus, Rad24 appears to function as an attachable nuclear-export signal that enhances the nuclear export of Cdc25 in response to DNA damage.},

Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) plays a negative role in insulin signaling and its inhibition improves insulin sensitivity. Metformin is a widely used insulin-sensitizing drug; however, the mechanism by which metformin acts is poorly understood. To gain insight into the role of PTEN, we examined the effect of metformin on PTEN expression. Metformin suppressed the expression of PTEN in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner in preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells. Knock-down of PTEN potentiated the increase in insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt/ERK. Metformin also increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-c-Jun and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-p70S6 kinase pathways. Both pharmacologic inhibition and knock-down of AMPK blocked metformin-induced phosphorylation of JNK and mTOR. Knock-down of AMPK recovered the metformin-induced PTEN down-regulation, suggesting the involvement of AMPK in PTEN regulation. PTEN promoter activity was suppressed by metformin and inhibition of mTOR and JNK by pharmacologic inhibitors blocked metformin-induced PTEN promoter activity suppression. These findings provide evidence for a novel role of AMPK on PTEN expression and thus suggest a possible mechanism by which metformin may contribute to its beneficial effects on insulin signaling.},

In contrast, the other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Bcl-W, and Bfl-1) suppressed apoptosis induced by overexpression of either Bax or Bak, and they displayed an ability to bind both Bax and Bak by at least one of the three protein interaction methods. Interestingly, however, full-length Bax and Bak proteins and synthetic Bax and Bak BH3 peptides exhibited discernible differences in their interactions with some anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, cautioning against reliance on a single method for detecting protein interactions of functional significance.

  abstract = {Progression through mitosis requires activation of cyclin B/Cdk1 and its downstream targets, including Polo-like kinase and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), the ubiquitin ligase directing degradation of cyclins A and B. Recent evidence shows that APC activation requires destruction of the APC inhibitor Emi1. In prophase, phosphorylation of Emi1 generates a D-pS-G-X-X-pS degron to recruit the SCF(betaTrCP) ubiquitin ligase, causing Emi1 destruction and allowing progression beyond prometaphase, but the kinases directing this phosphorylation remain undefined. We show here that the polo-like kinase Plk1 is strictly required for Emi1 destruction and that overexpression of Plk1 is sufficient to trigger Emi1 destruction.

The APC/C coactivator, Cdc20, is targeted by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to restrict APC/C activity until metaphase, yet early substrates, such as cyclin A, are degraded in the presence of the active checkpoint. Cdc20 and the cyclin-dependent kinase cofactor, Cks, are required for cyclin A destruction, but how they enable checkpoint-resistant destruction has not been elucidated. In this study, we answer this problem: we show that the N terminus of cyclin A binds directly to Cdc20 and with sufficient affinity that it can outcompete the SAC proteins. Subsequently, the Cks protein is necessary and sufficient to promote cyclin A degradation in the presence of an active checkpoint by binding cyclin A-Cdc20 to the APC/C.},

To study the regulatory role of FoxM1 and its downstream regulatory targets, three stably transfected HeLa lines that display doxycycline (dox)-inducible FoxM1 expression were established. Over-expression of FoxM1 by dox induction facilitates growth recovery from serum starvation. Quantitation of cyclin B1 and D1 levels using flow cytometric, Western and Northern analyses reveals that elevated FoxM1 levels lead to stimulation of cyclin B1 but not cyclin D1 expression.

EMT converts adherent epithelial cells to motile mesenchymal cells, favoring metastasis in the context of cancer progression. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) triggers EMT via intracellular Smad transducers and other signaling proteins. We previously reported that the high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) gene is required for TGF-beta to elicit EMT in mammary epithelial cells. In the present study we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which HMGA2 induces EMT. We found that HMGA2 regulates expression of many important repressors of E-cadherin. Among these, we analyzed in detail the zinc-finger transcription factor SNAIL1, which plays key roles in tumor progression and EMT. We demonstrate that HMGA2 directly binds to the SNAIL1 promoter and acts as a transcriptional regulator of SNAIL1 expression. Furthermore, we observed that HMGA2 cooperates with the TGF-beta/Smad pathway in regulating SNAIL1 gene expression. The mechanism behind this cooperation involves physical interaction between these factors, leading to an increased binding of Smads to the SNAIL1 promoter. SNAIL1 seems to play the role of a master effector downstream of HMGA2 for induction of EMT, as SNAIL1 knock-down partially reverts HMGA2-induced loss of epithelial differentiation. The data propose that HMGA2 acts in a gene-specific manner to orchestrate the transcriptional network necessary for the EMT program.},

Efforts to understand cell fate control have focused on simple gene regulatory circuits that predict the presence of multiple stable states, bifurcations and switch-like transitions. However, existing gene network models do not explain more complex properties of cell fate dynamics such as the hierarchical branching of developmental paths. Here, we construct a generic minimal model of the genetic regulatory network controlling cell fate determination, which exhibits five elementary characteristics of cell differentiation: stability, directionality, branching, exclusivity, and promiscuous expression. We argue that a modular architecture comprising repeated network elements reproduces these features of differentiation by sequentially repressing selected modules and hence restricting the dynamics to lower dimensional subspaces of the high-dimensional state space. We implement our model both with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to explore the role of bifurcations in producing the one-way character of differentiation, and with stochastic differential equations (SDEs), to demonstrate the effect of noise on the system. We further argue that binary cell fate decisions are prevalent in cell differentiation due to general features of the underlying dynamical system. This minimal model makes testable predictions about the structural basis for directional, discrete and diversifying cell phenotype development and thus can guide the evaluation of real gene regulatory networks that govern differentiation.},

In many cases, PCD is induced by the withdrawal of specific hormones or growth factors that function as survival factors. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as a cell survival factor. Our results indicate that in the absence of any ECM interactions, human endothelial cells rapidly undergo PCD, as determined by cell morphology, nuclei fragmentation, DNA degradation, protein cross-linking, and the expression of the PCD-specific gene TRPM-2. PCD was blocked by plating cells on an immobilized integrin beta 1 antibody but not by antibodies to either the class I histocompatibility antigen (HLA) or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), suggesting that integrin-mediated signals were required for maintaining cell viability. Treatment of the cells in suspension with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate also blocked PCD. When other cell types were examined, some, but not all, underwent rapid cell death when deprived of adhesion to the ECM. These results suggest that in addition to regulating cell growth and differentiation, the ECM also functions as a survival factor for many cell types.},

Whereas several feedback loops have been shown to regulate EMT, it remains elusive how they coordinately modulate EMT response to TGF-{$\beta$} treatment. We construct a mathematical model for the core regulatory network controlling TGF-{$\beta$}-induced EMT. Through deterministic analyses and stochastic simulations, we show that EMT is a sequential two-step program in which an epithelial cell first is converted to partial EMT then to the mesenchymal state, depending on the strength and duration of TGF-{$\beta$} stimulation. Mechanistically the system is governed by coupled reversible and irreversible bistable switches. The SNAIL1/miR-34 double-negative feedback loop is responsible for the reversible switch and regulates the initiation of EMT, whereas the ZEB/miR-200 feedback loop is accountable for the irreversible switch and controls the establishment of the mesenchymal state. Furthermore, an autocrine TGF-{$\beta$}/miR-200 feedback loop makes the second switch irreversible, modulating the maintenance of EMT. Such coupled bistable switches are robust to parameter variation and molecular noise. We provide a mechanistic explanation on multiple experimental observations. The model makes several explicit predictions on hysteretic dynamic behaviors, system response to pulsed stimulation, and various perturbations, which can be straightforwardly tested.},

Emi1 immunodepletion from cycling Xenopus extracts strongly delays cyclin B accumulation and mitotic entry, whereas nondestructible Emi1 stabilizes APC substrates and causes a mitotic block. Emi1 binds the APC activator Cdc20, and Cdc20 can rescue an Emi1-induced block to cyclin B destruction.

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammation of the coronary arteries. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) stimulated by cytokines and chemokines accelerate the inflammatory response and migrate to the injured endothelium during the progression of atherosclerosis. Activation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key sensor maintaining metabolic homeostasis, suppresses the inflammatory response. However, how AMPK regulates the inflammatory response is poorly understood. To identify the mechanism of this response, we focused on phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which is a negative regulator of inflammation. We investigated that activation of AMPK-induced PTEN expression and suppression of the inflammatory response through the AMPK-PTEN pathway in VSMCs. We treated with the well-known AMPK activator metformin to induce PTEN expression. PTEN was induced by metformin (2mM) and inhibited by compound C (10 {$\mu$}M) and AMPK siRNA. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}) was used to induce inflammation. The inflammatory response was confirmed by cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-{$\kappa$}B. Metformin suppressed COX-2 and iNOS mRNA and protein expression dose dependently. Treatment with compound C and bpv (pic) in the presence of metformin, iNOS and COX-2 protein expression increased. NF-{$\kappa$}B activation decreased in response to metformin and was restored by inhibiting AMPK and PTEN. Inhibiting AMPK and PTEN restored ROS levels stimulated with TNF-{$\alpha$}. Taken together, PTEN could be a possible downstream regulator of AMPK, and the AMPK-PTEN pathway might be important in the regulation of the inflammatory response in VSMCs.},

  abstract = {Bik is a potent pro-apoptotic protein, which complexes with various anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, 19-kDa adenovirus E1B, and EBV-BHRF1. The mechanism by which Bik promotes cell death is not known. It shares a conserved domain, BH3, with other pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax, Bak, Bid, and Hrk, and certain anti-apoptosis proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Mutations within the BH3 domain of Bik abrogate its ability to induce cell death and to complex with anti-apoptosis proteins. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that Bik may promote cell death by complexing with and antagonizing the activity of endogenous cellular anti-apoptosis proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. To elucidate the relationship between protein complex formation and induction of cell death, we have identified the minimal sequences of Bik, from a library of N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants, required for interaction with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and for inducing efficient cell death. Two-hybrid analysis in yeast and immunoprecipitation analysis of proteins expressed in mammalian cells indicate that a 52-amino acid region (amino acids 43-94) of Bik, encompassing the BH3 domain, is sufficient for efficient heterodimerization with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Protein interaction studies further reveal that an 18-amino acid region, encompassing the BH3 domain (residues 57-74), constitutes the core heterodimerization domain. Functional analysis indicates that a Bik deletion mutant expressing residues 43-120, which efficiently heterodimerizes with the anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, is defective in eliciting cell death. In contrast, a mutant expressing additional C-terminal sequences (amino acids 43-134) interacts with the survival proteins and elicits efficient cell death. Our results suggest that for Bik-mediated cell death, the heterodimerization activity encoded by the BH3 domain alone is insufficient and raise the possibility that Bik may induce cell death autonomous of heterodimerization with survival proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.},

Dissociation of cell\textendash cell contacts and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton are major events of the EMT. Here, we show that myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs; also known as MAL and MKL) are critical mediators of transforming growth factor {$\beta$} (TGF-{$\beta$}) 1\textendash induced EMT. In all epithelial cell lines examined here, TGF-{$\beta$}1 triggers the nuclear translocation of MRTFs. Ectopic expression of constitutive-active MRTF-A induces EMT, whereas dominant-negative MRTF-A or knockdown of MRTF-A and -B prevents the TGF-{$\beta$}1\textendash induced EMT. MRTFs form complexes with Smad3. Via Smad3, the MRTF\textendash Smad3 complexes bind to a newly identified cis-element GCCG-like motif in the promoter region of Canis familiaris and the human slug gene, which activates slug transcription and thereby dissociation of cell\textendash cell contacts. MRTFs also increase the expression levels of actin cytoskeletal proteins via serum response factor, thereby triggering reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

During various tissue remodelling events, such as wound healing or carcinoma invasion, changes in the physical properties, and/or composition of the extracellular matrix, can lead to anoikis of epithelial cells that lack appropriate receptor-matrix interactions. Laminin-5 is the major ligand for keratinocyte adhesion in the epidermis, and it also promotes keratinocyte survival in vivo and in vitro. Integrins alpha 3 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4 are the major receptors for laminin-5; however, specific roles for these integrins in keratinocyte survival have not been determined. In the current study, we exploited keratinocyte cell lines derived from wild-type or alpha 3 integrin knockout mice to reveal a critical role for alpha 3 beta 1 in protecting keratinocytes from apoptosis upon serum withdrawal. We show that alpha 3 beta 1-mediated adhesion to laminin-5 extracellular matrix inhibits proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and TUNEL-staining, both hallmarks of apoptosis. We also show that alpha 3 beta1-mediated adhesion activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and that inhibition of either FAK or ERK signaling leads to apoptosis of keratinocytes attached to laminin-5. alpha 6 beta 4-mediated adhesion to laminin-5 only partially protects cells from apoptosis in the absence of alpha 3 beta 1, and alpha 6 beta 4 is not necessary for cell survival in the presence of alpha 3 beta 1. These results suggest that alpha 3 beta 1 is necessary and sufficient for maximal keratinocyte survival on laminin-5. We propose a model to address the potential importance of alpha 3 beta 1-mediated survival for migrating keratinocytes at the leading edge of a cutaneous wound.},

Mitotic stabilization of Cdc25A reflects its phosphorylation on Ser17 and Ser115 by cyclin B-Cdk1, modifications required to uncouple Cdc25A from its ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated turnover. Cdc25A binds and activates cyclin B-Cdk1, accelerates cell division when overexpressed, and its downregulation by RNA interference (RNAi) delays mitotic entry. DNA damage-induced G(2) arrest, in contrast, is accompanied by proteasome-dependent destruction of Cdc25A, and ectopic Cdc25A abrogates the G(2) checkpoint. Thus, phosphorylation-mediated switches among three differentially stable forms ensure distinct thresholds, and thereby distinct roles for Cdc25A in multiple cell cycle transitions and checkpoints.},

In long term cultures of primary mammary epithelial cells, a laminin-rich basement membrane (BM) but not collagen I suppresses apoptosis, indicating that adhesion survival signals are specific in their response (. J. Cell Sci. 109:631-642). We now demonstrate that the signal from BM is mediated by integrins and requires both the alpha6 and beta1 subunits. In addition, a hormonal signal from insulin or insulin-like growth factors, but not hydrocortisone or prolactin, is necessary to suppress mammary cell apoptosis, indicating that BM and soluble factors cooperate in survival signaling. Insulin induced autophosphorylation of its receptor whether mammary cells were cultured on collagen I or BM substrata. However, both the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and its association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were enhanced in cells cultured on BM, as was the phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase effector, protein kinase B. These results suggest a novel extracellular matrix-dependent restriction point in insulin signaling in mammary epithelial cells. The proximal signal transduction event of insulin receptor phosphorylation is not dependent on extracellular matrix, but the activation of downstream effectors requires adhesion to BM. Since phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was required for mammary epithelial cell survival, we propose that a possible mechanism for BM-mediated suppression of apoptosis is through its facilitative effects on insulin signaling.},

Although bet hedging is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, direct evidence for an adaptive origin of this behaviour is lacking. Here we report the de novo evolution of bet hedging in experimental bacterial populations. Bacteria were subjected to an environment that continually favoured new phenotypic states. Initially, our regime drove the successive evolution of novel phenotypes by mutation and selection; however, in two (of 12) replicates this trend was broken by the evolution of bet-hedging genotypes that persisted because of rapid stochastic phenotype switching. Genome re-sequencing of one of these switching types revealed nine mutations that distinguished it from the ancestor. The final mutation was both necessary and sufficient for rapid phenotype switching; nonetheless, the evolution of bet hedging was contingent upon earlier mutations that altered the relative fitness effect of the final mutation. These findings capture the adaptive evolution of bet hedging in the simplest of organisms, and suggest that risk-spreading strategies may have been among the earliest evolutionary solutions to life in fluctuating environments.},

To further understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Hippo signaling regulation, we have found that activities of core Hippo signaling components, large tumor suppressor (LATS) kinases and YAP/TAZ transcription factors, oscillate during mitotic cell cycle. We further identified that the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)Cdh1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a key role governing eukaryotic cell cycle progression, intrinsically regulates Hippo signaling activities. CDH1 recognizes LATS kinases to promote their degradation and, hence, YAP/TAZ regulation by LATS phosphorylation is under cell cycle control. As a result, YAP/TAZ activities peak in G1 phase. Furthermore, we show in Drosophila eye and wing development that Cdh1 is required in vivo to regulate the LATS homolog Warts with a conserved mechanism. Cdh1 reduction increased Warts levels, which resulted in reduction of the eye and wing sizes in a Yorkie dependent manner. Therefore, LATS degradation by APC/CCdh1 represents a previously unappreciated and evolutionarily conserved layer of Hippo signaling regulation.},

Currently, the mode of action of dSpry is unknown, and the point of inhibition remains controversial. There are at least four mammalian Spry isoforms that have been shown to co-express preferentially with FGFRs as compared with EGFRs. In this study, we investigated the effects of the various mammalian Spry isoforms on the Ras/MAP kinase pathway in cells overexpressing constitutively active FGFR1. hSpry2 was significantly more potent than mSpry1 or mSpry4 in inhibiting the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Additional experiments indicated that full-length hSpry2 was required for its full potency. hSpry2 had no inhibitory effect on either the JNK or the p38 pathway and displayed no inhibition of FRS2 phosphorylation, Akt activation, and Ras activation. Constitutively active mutants of Ras, Raf, and Mek were employed to locate the prospective point of inhibition of hSpry2 downstream of activated Ras. Results from this study indicated that hSpry2 exerted its inhibitory effect at the level of Raf, which was verified in a Raf activation assay in an FGF signaling context.},

Here, we report that Yes-associated protein (YAP), a central transcriptional regulator implicated in controlling organ and body size, modulates a Rho-GTPase switch that drives cellular migration by directly transactivating the Rac1-GEF protein TRIO. Additionally, YAP and TRIO activate STAT3 to promote invasive behavior. While we find this YAP-dependent infiltrative program in many cell types, it is particularly enhanced in a patient specific way in the most common malignant brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM), where hyperactivation of the YAP-mediated TRIO and STAT3 network also confers poor patient outcome and up-regulation of genes associated with the Mesenchymal subtype of GBM. Our analysis suggests that the YAP-TRIO-STAT3 signaling network identified in this study is a ubiquitous regulator of invasive cell spread in a variety of normal and pathological contexts.},

  abstract = {Lineage specification of multipotent progenitor cells is governed by a balance of lineage-affiliated transcription factors, such as GATA1 and PU.1, which regulate the choice between erythroid and myelomonocytic fates. But how ratios of lineage-determining transcription factors stabilize progenitor cells and resolve their indeterminacy to commit them to discrete, mutually exclusive fates remains unexplained. We used a simple model and experimental measurements to analyze the dynamics of a binary fate decision governed by a gene-circuit containing auto-stimulation and cross-inhibition, as embodied by the GATA1-PU.1 paradigm. This circuit generates stable attractors corresponding to erythroid and myelomonocytic fates, as well as an uncommitted metastable state characterized by coexpression of both regulators, explaining the phenomenon of "multilineage priming". GATA1 and PU.1 mRNA and transcriptome dynamics of differentiating progenitor cells confirm that commitment occurs in two stages, as suggested by the model: first, the progenitor state is destabilized in an almost symmetrical bifurcation event, resulting in a poised state at the boundary between the two lineage-specific attractors; second, the cell is driven to the respective, now accessible attractors. This minimal model captures fundamental features of binary cell fate decisions, uniting the concepts of stochastic (selective) and deterministic (instructive) regulation, and hence, may apply to a wider range of binary fate decision points.},

Neither vWf nor vWf propolypeptide (von Willebrand antigen II) were detectable in plasma, platelets, or endothelial cells of the homozygous mutant mice. The mutant mice exhibited defects in hemostasis with a highly prolonged bleeding time and spontaneous bleeding events in {$\approx$}10\% of neonates. As in the human disease, the factor VIII level in these mice was reduced strongly as a result of the lack of protection provided by vWf. Defective thrombosis in mutant mice was also evident in an in vivo model of vascular injury. In this model, the exteriorized mesentery was superfused with ferric chloride and the accumulation of fluorescently labeled platelets was observed by intravital microscopy. We conclude that these mice very closely mimic severe human von Willebrand disease and will be very useful for investigating the role of vWf in normal physiology and in disease models.},

This introductory article reviews fundamental facts and concepts about phenotypic plasticity, adopting the most authoritative terminology in use in the current literature.

Analysis of a model of gene interactions based on differential equations showed that wild-type expression patterns of these genes can be obtained for a wide range of kinetic parameters, which suggests that the steady states are determined by the topology of the network and the type of regulatory interactions between components, not the detailed form of the rate laws. To investigate this, we propose and analyse a Boolean model of this network which is based on a binary ON/OFF representation of mRNA and protein levels, and in which the interactions are formulated as logical functions. In this model the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression are determined by the topology of the network and whether components are present or absent, rather than the absolute levels of the mRNAs and proteins and the functional details of their interactions. The model is able to reproduce the wild-type gene expression patterns, as well as the ectopic expression patterns observed in overexpression experiments and various mutants. Furthermore, we compute explicitly all steady states of the network and identify the basin of attraction of each steady state. The model gives important insights into the functioning of the segment polarity gene network, such as the crucial role of the wingless and sloppy paired genes, and the network's ability to correct errors in the pre-pattern.},

Initially characterized as a prototypical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor, Snai2 has been shown more recently to participate in a wider variety of biological processes, including tumor metastasis, stem and/or progenitor cell biology, cellular differentiation, vascular remodeling and DNA damage repair. The main role of Snai2 in controlling such processes involves facilitating the epigenetic regulation of transcriptional programs, and, as such, its dysregulation manifests in developmental defects, disruption of tissue homeostasis, and other disease conditions. Here, we discuss our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating Snai2 expression, abundance and activity. In addition, we outline how these mechanisms contribute to disease phenotypes or how they may impact rational therapeutic targeting of Snai2 dysregulation in human disease.},

The modulation of cell migration by p27 (officially known as CDKN1B) has been reported, but the exact mechanism(s) whereby p27 interacts with downstream effectors that control cell migration have not been elucidated. By systematically comparing p27(+/+) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with genetically ablated p27(-/-) MEFs using wound-healing, transwell and time-lapse microscopic analyses, we provide direct evidence that p27 inhibits both directional and random cell migration. Identical results were obtained with normal and cancer epithelial cells using complementary knockdown and overexpression approaches. Additional studies revealed that overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD, officially known as SOD2) and reduced intracellular oxidation played a key role in increased cell migration in p27-deficient cells. Furthermore, we identified signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as the transcription factor responsible for p27-regulated MnSOD expression, which was further mediated by ERK- and ATF1-dependent transactivation of the cAMP response element (CRE) within the Stat3 promoter. Collectively, our data strongly indicate that p27 plays a crucial negative role in cell migration by inhibiting MnSOD expression in a STAT3-dependent manner.},

Recent studies have found that the FAK-Src complex is activated in many tumor cells and generates signals leading to tumor growth and metastasis.

Here we report the use of polymerase chain reaction-aided genomic sequencing to determine the complete methylation pattern of this region in clones derived from X8-6T2 cells after treatment with the methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine. We find (i) a clone showing full expression of human phosphoglycerate kinase is fully unmethylated in this region; (ii) clones not expressing human phosphoglycerate kinase remain methylated at approximately 50\% of CpG sites, with a pattern of interspersed methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) sites different for each clone; (iii) singles, defined as M-U-M or U-M-U, are common; and (iv) a few CpG sites are partially methylated. The data are interpreted according to a model of multiple, autonomous CpG sites, and estimates are made for two key parameters, maintenance efficiency (Em approximately 99.9\% per site per generation) and de novo methylation efficiency (Ed approximately 5\%). These parameter values and the hypothesis that several independent sites must be unmethylated for transcription can explain the stable maintenance of X chromosome inactivation. We also consider how the active region is kept free of methylation and suggest that transcription inhibits methylation by decreasing Em so that methylation cannot be maintained. Thus, multiple CpG sites, independent with respect to a dynamic methylation system, can stabilize two alternative states of methylation and transcription.},

Merlin, through competitive binding to Angiomotin, releases Rich1 from the Angiomotin-inhibitory complex, allowing Rich1 to inactivate Rac1, ultimately leading to attenuation of Rac1 and Ras-MAPK pathways. Patient-derived Merlin mutants show diminished binding capacities to Angiomotin and are unable to dissociate Rich1 from Angiomotin or inhibit MAPK signaling.

In this article we have analyzed the factors controlling Zeb1 expression during EMT. In NMuMG cells treated with TGF-{$\beta$}, Snail1 RNA and protein are induced 1 h after addition of the cytokine preceding Zeb1 up-regulation that requires 6-8 h. Zeb1 gene expression is caused by increased RNA levels but also by enhanced protein stability and is markedly dependent on Snail1 because depletion of this protein prevents Zeb1 protein and RNA up-regulation. In addition to Snail1, depletion of the Twist transcriptional factor retards Zeb1 stimulation by TGF-{$\beta$} or decreases Zeb1 expression in other cellular models indicating that this factor is also required for Zeb1 expression. Accordingly, Snail1 and Twist cooperate in the induction of Zeb1: co-transfection of both cDNAs is required for the maximal expression of ZEB1 mRNA. Unexpectedly, the expression of Snail1 and Twist shows a mutual dependence although to a different extent; whereas Twist depletion retards Snail1 up-regulation by TGF-{$\beta$}, Snail1 is necessary for the rapid increase in Twist protein and later up-regulation of Twist1 mRNA induced by the cytokine. Besides this effect on Twist, Snail1 also induces the nuclear translocation of Ets1, another factor required for Zeb1 expression. Both Twist and Ets1 bind to the ZEB1 promoter although to different elements: whereas Ets1 interacts with the proximal promoter, Twist does it with a 700-bp sequence upstream of the transcription start site. These results indicate that Snail1 controls Zeb1 expression at multiple levels and acts cooperatively with Twist in the ZEB1 gene transcription induction.},

Next, the effects of YAP knockdown and YAP inhibitor on CML cells were evaluated by MTT assay, flow cytometry (FCM) and Wright's staining. Moreover, K562 induced mice model was employed to further investigate the role of YAP in vivo. RESULTS: YAP was overexpressed in CML cells. Knockdown of YAP by si-RNA or inhibition the function of YAP using verteporfin (VP) not only inhibited the proliferation, induced the apoptosis of CML cells but also reduced the expression of YAP target genes c-myc and survivin. Additionally, VP enhanced the efficacy of imatinib (IM) in vitro and suppressed leukemogenesis in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that YAP may play an important role in the proliferation and leukemogenesis of CML cells. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of YAP provides a novel treatment strategy for CML.},

There was no apparent association between ischemic stroke incidence and factor VIIc, antithrombin III, platelet count, or activated partial thromboplastin time. After adjustment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors, von Willebrand factor, factor VIIIc, fibrinogen, and white blood cell count were positively associated and protein C was negatively but nonsignificantly associated with ischemic stroke incidence in regression analyses based on either continuous variables or fourths of the variable distributions. The adjusted relative risk (and 95\% CI) for ischemic stroke in those in the highest versus lowest fourth were: von Willebrand factor, 1.71 (1.1 to 2.7); factor VIIIc, 1.93 (1.2 to 3.1); white blood cell count, 1.50 (0.9 to 2.4); fibrinogen, 1.26 (0.8 to 2.0); and protein C, 0.65 (0.4 to 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: This study offers modest support for the hypothesis that some markers of hemostatic function and inflammation can identify groups of middle-aged adults at increased risk of stroke. These factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.},

We present an extensive experimental/computational study of an HIV-1 model vector (LTR-GFP-IRES-Tat) and show that stochastic fluctuations in Tat influence the viral latency decision. Low GFP/Tat expression was found to generate bifurcating phenotypes with clonal populations derived from single proviral integrations simultaneously exhibiting very high and near zero GFP expression. Although phenotypic bifurcation (PheB) was correlated with distinct genomic integration patterns, neither these patterns nor other extrinsic cellular factors (cell cycle/size, aneuploidy, chromatin silencing, etc.) explained PheB. Stochastic computational modeling successfully accounted for PheB and correctly predicted the dynamics of a Tat mutant that were subsequently confirmed by experiment. Thus, Tat stochastics appear sufficient to generate PheB (and potentially proviral latency), illustrating the importance of stochastic fluctuations in gene expression in a mammalian system.},

This report demonstrates a p16INK4A-dependent positive regulation of p53 expression, at the protein level, in various human cells as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. p16 suppresses p53 turnover through inhibition of its MDM2-related ubiquitination. This effect occurs through p16-related promotion of the MDM2 mRNA turnover via the p16INK4A downstream effectors miR-141 and miR-146b-5p, which bind specific sites at the 3' untranslated region of the MDM2 mRNA.Implications: The current findings show p16INK4A-dependent stabilization of p53 through miR-141/miR-146b-5p-related posttranscriptional repression of MDM2, thus providing new insights into the complex functional link between p16INK4A and p53.

APC/C and Cdc20 are already present during interphase but APC/C-Cdc20 regulation during this window of the cell cycle, if any, is unknown. Here we show that cyclin A2-Cdk2 binds and phosphorylates Cdc20 in interphase and this inhibits APC/C-Cdc20 activity. Preventing Cdc20 phosphorylation results in pre-mature activation of the APC/C-Cdc20 and several substrates, including cyclin B1 and A2, are destabilized which lengthens G2 and slows mitotic entry. Expressing non-degradable cyclin A2 but not cyclin B1 restores mitotic entry in these cells. We have thus uncovered a novel positive feedback loop centred on cyclin A2-Cdk2 inhibition of interphase APC/C-Cdc20 to allow further cyclin A2 accumulation and mitotic entry.},

The rarity of reprogramming events appears to contradict the robustness with which the unfathomably complex phenotype of stem cells can reliably be generated. This apparent paradox, however, is naturally explained by the rugged "epigenetic landscape" with valleys representing "preprogrammed" attractor states that emerge from the dynamical constraints of the gene regulatory network. This article provides a pedagogical primer to the fundamental principles of gene regulatory networks as integrated dynamic systems and reviews recent insights in gene expression noise and fate determination, thereby offering a formal framework that may help us to understand why cell fate reprogramming events are inherently rare and yet so robust.},

  abstract = {Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) regulates essential cellular functions such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family of proteins has been implicated as mediators of TGFbeta-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated previously that TGFbeta induces the expression of Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death), a member of the BH3-only family of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, to induce cell death in B-lymphocytes. Here, we investigated the mechanism of TGFbeta-mediated Bim expression in two hepatocyte cell lines that undergo apoptosis with TGFbeta, AML-12 and Hep3B. We show that TGFbeta induces Bim protein and mRNA levels, and its expression is sufficient to induce cell death. Gene array results revealed that Runx1, a member of the Runx family of transcription factors, was induced by TGFbeta, and this induction was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, TGFbeta specifically induced the expression of Runx1 protein from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent, cap-independent, mRNA transcript, and its overexpression was sufficient to induce hepatocyte apo pto sis. Deletion and mutation analyses of the murine Bim promoter identified a putative forkhead binding element, at position -174 to -168 from the transcription start site, as the mediator of Runx1 induction. Co-immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Runx1 does not bind directly to the identified forkhead binding element but rather binds the transcriptional regulator FOXO3, which occupies this site. Finally, small interfering RNA knockdown of Runx1 or FOXO3 decreased TGFbeta-induced Bim expression. Our results support a mechanism in which TGFbeta stimulates Bim transcription by up-regulating Runx1 expression, which binds FOXO3, and the two cooperate in the transcriptional induction of Bim.},

In capillaries, the mosaicism is dynamically regulated, with VWF switching between ON and OFF states during the lifetime of the animal. Clonal analysis of cultured endothelial cells reveals that dynamic mosaic heterogeneity is controlled by a low-barrier, noise-sensitive bistable switch that involves random transitions in the DNA methylation status of the VWF promoter. Finally, the hearts of VWF-null mice demonstrate an abnormal endothelial phenotype as well as cardiac dysfunction. Together, these findings suggest a novel stochastic phenotype switching strategy for adaptive homoeostasis in the adult vasculature.},

The use of deletions and point mutations of the c-myc promoter demonstrated that in both cell types, the E2F binding sites are necessary for such transactivation. Unexpectedly however, over-expression of RB caused an overall transcriptional activation of the c-myc promoter. We resolved this apparent paradox by demonstrating that this activation is a combination of two antagonistic effects: transcriptional repression mediated by the E2F factor, and transcriptional activation independent of this factor. RB was also found to prevent LT-mediated transactivation, and LT inhibited RB-mediated activation independently of the E2F factor. LT therefore antagonizes both the transcriptional repression and activation mediated by RB.},

Transcriptional coactivators, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {$\gamma$} coactivator-1 (PGC-1) {$\alpha$} and PGC-1{$\beta$}, have been shown to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis in the heart at the time of birth. The function of PGC-1 coactivators in the heart after birth has been incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the role of PGC-1 coactivators during postnatal cardiac development and in adult hearts in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Conditional gene targeting was used in mice to explore the role of PGC-1 coactivators during postnatal cardiac development and in adult hearts. Marked mitochondrial structural derangements were observed in hearts of PGC-1{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}-deficient mice during postnatal growth, including fragmentation and elongation, associated with the development of a lethal cardiomyopathy. The expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Opa1) and fission (Drp1, Fis1) was altered in the hearts of PGC-1{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}-deficient mice. PGC-l{$\alpha$} was shown to directly regulate Mfn1 gene transcription by coactivating the estrogen-related receptor {$\alpha$} on a conserved DNA element. Surprisingly, PGC-1{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} deficiency in the adult heart did not result in evidence of abnormal mitochondrial dynamics or heart failure. However, transcriptional profiling demonstrated that PGC-1 coactivators are required for high-level expression of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded genes involved in mitochondrial dynamics and energy transduction in the adult heart. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal distinct developmental stage-specific programs involved in cardiac mitochondrial dynamics.},

Here, using an HIV-1 model system, we directly quantify transcriptional feedback strength and its effects on both the duration of HIV-1 Tat transcriptional pulses and the fate of HIV-infected cells. By measuring shifts in the autocorrelation of noise inherent to gene expression, we found that transcriptional positive feedback extends the single-cell Tat expression lifetime two- to sixfold for both minimal Tat circuits and full length, actively replicating HIV-1. Notably, artificial weakening of Tat positive feedback shortened the duration of Tat expression transients and biased the probability in favor of latency. Thus, transcriptional positive feedback can modulate transient expression lifetime to a greater extent than protein half-life modulation, and it has a critical role in the cell-fate decision in HIV.},

Signalling pathways downstream of most cellular stresses converge on TSC1/2, which serves as an integration point that inhibits mTORC1. The TSC1/2 complex was shown to translocate to lysosomes to inactivate mTORC1 in response to two stresses: amino-acid starvation and growth factor removal. Whether other stresses also regulate TSC2 localization is not known. How TSC2 localization responds to combinations of stresses and other stimuli is also unknown. We show that both amino acids and growth factors are required simultaneously to maintain TSC2 cytoplasmic; when one of the two is missing, TSC2 relocalizes to lysosomes. Furthermore, multiple different stresses that inhibit mTORC1 also drive TSC2 lysosomal accumulation. Our findings indicate that lysosomal recruitment of TSC2 is a universal response to stimuli that inactivate mTORC1, and that the presence of any single stress is sufficient to cause TSC2 lysosomal localization.},

  abstract = {Transmembrane roundabout receptor family members (ROBO1\textendash ROBO4) principally orchestrate the neuronal guidance mechanism of the nervous system. Secreted glycoprotein SLITs are the most appreciated ligands for ROBOs. Recently identified ROBO4 is the key mediator of SLIT-ROBO mediated developmental and pathological angiogenesis. Although SLIT2 has been shown to interact with ROBO4 as ligand, it remains an open question whether this protein is the physiologic partner of ROBO4. The purpose of this review is to summarise how reliable SLIT2 as ligand for ROBO4 is, if not what the other possible mechanisms demonstrated till date for ROBO4 mediated developmental and pathological angiogenesis are. We conclude that ROBO4 is expressed specially in vascular endothelial cells and maintains the vascular integrity via either SLIT2 dependent or SLIT2 independent manner. On the contrary, it promotes the pathological angiogenesis by involving different signalling arm(s)/unknown ligand(s). This review explores the interactions SLIT2/ROBO1, SLIT2/ROBO1\textendash ROBO4, ROBO1/ROBO4, and ROBO4/UNC5B which can be promising and potential therapeutic targets for developmental angiogenesis defects and pathological angiogenesis. Finally we have reviewed the ROBO4 signalling pathways and made an effort to elaborate the insight of this signalling as therapeutic target of pathological angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-AKT-mTOR pathways sense the availability of nutrients and mitogens and respond by signaling for cell growth and division. The p53 pathway senses a variety of stress signals which will reduce the fidelity of cell growth and division, and responds by initiating cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis. This study explores four p53-regulated gene products, the beta1 and beta2 subunits of the AMPK, which are shown for the first time to be regulated by the p53 protein, TSC2, PTEN, and IGF-BP3, each of which negatively regulates the IGF-1-AKT-mTOR pathways after stress. These gene products are shown to be expressed under p53 control in a cell type and tissue-specific fashion with the TSC2 and PTEN proteins being coordinately regulated in those tissues that use insulin-dependent energy metabolism (skeletal muscle, heart, white fat, liver, and kidney). In addition, these genes are regulated by p53 in a stress signal-specific fashion. The mTOR pathway also communicates with the p53 pathway. After glucose starvation of mouse embryo fibroblasts, AMPK phosphorylates the p53 protein but does not activate any of the p53 responses. Upon glucose starvation of E1A-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts, a p53-mediated apoptosis ensues. Thus, there is a great deal of communication between the p53 pathway and the IGF-1-AKT and mTOR pathways.},

The activity of Cdc25A is itself regulated in part by positive and negative feedback regulatory loops performed by its CDK-cyclin substrates that occur in G1 as well as during the G1/S and G2/M transitions. However, the regulation of Cdc25A during G2 phase progression before mitotic entry has not been intensively characterized. Here, we identify by mass spectrometry analysis a new phosphorylation event of Cdc25A on Serine283. Phospho-specific antibodies revealed that the phosphorylation of this residue appears in late S/G2 phase of an unperturbed cell cycle and is performed by CDK-cyclin complexes. Overexpression studies of wild-type and non-phosphorylatable mutant forms of Cdc25A indicated that Ser283 phosphorylation increases the G2/M-promoting activity of the phosphatase without impacting its stability or subcellular localization. Our results therefore identify a new positive regulatory loop between Cdc25A and its CDK-cyclin substrates which contributes to accelerate entry into mitosis through the regulation of Cdc25A activity in G2.},

We demonstrate that cell cycle-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is important in switching cells from mitotic arrest to apoptosis during MIAs treatment. Overexpression of non-degradable cyclin B1 sustained CDK1 activation and mitotic arrest, followed by caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. CDK1 is responsible for the phosphorylation of several pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins during MIAs treatment. CDK1-mediated Bcl-2 serine 70 phosphorylation enhances its pro-apoptotic function, whereas CDK1-mediated Bad serine 128 phosphorylation promotes apoptosis. Blockage of CDK1 activity with a specific pharmacological inhibitor suppresses Mcl-1 phosphorylation, degradation and its anti-apoptotic function. Therefore, the death of cancer cells under MIAs treatment was caused by imbalance between CDK1-induced alterations in the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic functions of phosphorylated Bcl-2 family proteins.},

  abstract = {The N-terminal domain of the c-Myc protein has been reported to be critical for both the transactivation and biological functions of the c-Myc proteins. Through detailed phosphopeptide mapping analyses, we demonstrate that there is a cluster of four regulated and complex phosphorylation events on the N-terminal domain of Myc proteins, including Thr-58, Ser-62, and Ser-71. An apparent enhancement of Ser-62 phosphorylation occurs on v-Myc proteins having a mutation at Thr-58 which has previously been correlated with increased transforming ability. In contrast, phosphorylation of Thr-58 in cells is dependent on a prior phosphorylation of Ser-62. Hierarchical phosphorylation of c-Myc is also observed in vitro with a specific glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha, unlike the promiscuous phosphorylation observed with other glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha and 3 beta preparations. Although both p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and cdc2 kinase specifically phosphorylate Ser-62 in vitro and cellular phosphorylation of Thr-58/Ser-62 is stimulated by mitogens, other in vivo experiments do not support a role for these kinases in the phosphorylation of Myc proteins. Unexpectedly, both the Thr-58 and Ser-62 phosphorylation events, but not other N-terminal phosphorylation events, can occur in the cytoplasm, suggesting that translocation of the c-Myc proteins to the nucleus is not required for phosphorylation at these sites. In addition, there appears to be an unusual block to the phosphorylation of Ser-62 during mitosis. Finally, although the enhanced transforming properties of Myc proteins correlates with the loss of phosphorylation at Thr-58 and an enhancement of Ser-62 phosphorylation, these phosphorylation events do not alter the ability of c-Myc to transactivate through the CACGTG Myc/Max binding site.},

Resistance to anoikis is a critical contributor to tumor invasion and metastasis. The phenomenon is regulated by integrins, which upon engagement with components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) form adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton drives the formation of cell protrusions used to adhere to ECM, directing cell migration. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) confers stem cell properties and leads to acquisition of a migratory and invasive phenotype by causing adherens junction breakdown and circumventing anoikis in the tumor microenvironment. The investigation of drug discovery platforms for apoptosis-driven therapeutics identified several novel agents with antitumor action via reversing resistance to anoikis, inhibiting survival pathways and impacting the EMT landscape in human cancer. In this review, we discuss current evidence on the contribution of the anoikis phenomenon functionally linked to EMT to cancer metastasis and the therapeutic value of antitumor drugs that selectively reverse anoikis resistance and/or EMT to impair tumor progression toward the development/optimization of apoptosis-driven therapeutic targeting of metastatic disease.},

It becomes enzymatically active at the end of mitosis. The activation of the cyclosome is initiated by its phosphorylation, a process necessary for its conversion to an active form by the ancillary protein Cdc20/Fizzy. Previous reports have implicated either cyclin-dependent kinase 1-cyclin B or polo-like kinase as the major protein kinase that directly phosphorylates and activates the cyclosome. These conflicting results could be due to the use of partially purified cyclosome preparations or of immunoprecipitated cyclosome, whose interactions with protein kinases or ancillary factors may be hampered by binding to immobilized antibody. To examine this problem, we have purified cyclosome from HeLa cells by a combination of affinity chromatography and ion exchange procedures. With the use of purified preparations, we found that both cyclin-dependent kinase 1-cyclin B and polo-like kinase directly phosphorylated the cyclosome, but the pattern of the phosphorylation of the different cyclosome subunits by the two protein kinases was not similar. Each protein kinase could restore only partially the cyclin-ubiquitin ligase activity of dephosphorylated cyclosome. However, following phosphorylation by both protein kinases, an additive and nearly complete restoration of cyclin-ubiquitin ligase activity was observed. It is suggested that this joint activation may be due to the complementary phosphorylation of different cyclosome subunits by the two protein kinases.},

Activation of NF-{$\kappa$}B blocks PCD induced by numerous triggers, including ligand engagement of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family receptors. The protective activity of NF-{$\kappa$}B is also crucial for oncogenesis and cancer chemoresistance. Downstream of TNF-Rs, this activity of NF-{$\kappa$}B has been linked to the suppression of reactive oxygen species and the c-Jun-N-terminal-kinase (JNK) cascade. The mechanism by which NF-{$\kappa$}B inhibits PCD triggered by chemotherapeutic drugs, however, remains poorly understood. To understand this mechanism, we sought to identify unrecognized protective genes that are regulated by NF-{$\kappa$}B. Using an unbiased screen, we identified the basic-helix-loop-helix factor Twist-1 as a new mediator of the protective function of NF-{$\kappa$}B. Twist-1 is an evolutionarily conserved target of NF-{$\kappa$}B, blocks PCD induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and TNF-{$\alpha$} in NF-{$\kappa$}B-deficient cells, and is essential to counter this PCD in cancer cells. The protective activity of Twist-1 seemingly halts PCD independently of interference with cytotoxic JNK, p53, and p19ARF signaling, suggesting that it mediates a novel protective mechanism activated by NF-{$\kappa$}B. Indeed, our data indicate that this activity involves a control of inhibitory Bcl-2 phosphorylation. The data also suggest that Twist-1 and -2 play an important role in NF-{$\kappa$}B-dependent chemoresistance.},

Mutations in the Sp1- or Smad-binding sequences decreased or abolished the TGF-beta responsiveness of the p15(Ink4B) promoter. Interference with, or deficiency in, Smad2, Smad3 or Smad4 functions also reduced or abolished the TGF-beta-dependent p15(Ink4B) induction, whereas the absence of Sp1 reduced the basal and TGF-beta-induced p15(Ink4B) transcription. In the nucleoprotein complex, Smad2 interacted through its C-domain with Sp1 and enhanced the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of Sp1. Smad3 interacted indirectly with Sp1 through its association with Smad2 and/or Smad4, and bound directly to the p15(Ink4B) promoter. Finally, Smad4 interacted through its N-domain with Sp1. Our data demonstrate the physical interactions and functional cooperativity of Sp1 with a complex of Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 in the induction of the p15(Ink4B) gene.

The progression of resulting adenomas is associated with oncogenic activation of KRas and inactivation of the p53 and TGF-{$\beta$}/Smad functions. Most established CRC cell lines contain mutations in the TGF-{$\beta$}/Smad pathway, but little is known about the function of TGF-{$\beta$} in the early phases of intestinal tumorigenesis. We used mouse and human ex vivo 3D intestinal organoid cultures and in vivo mouse models to study the effect of TGF-{$\beta$} on the Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells and their progeny in intestinal adenomas. We found that the TGF-{$\beta$}-induced apoptosis in Apc-mutant organoids, including the Lgr5(+) stem cells, was mediated by up-regulation of the BH3-only proapoptotic protein Bcl-2-like protein 11 (Bim). BH3-mimetic compounds recapitulated the effect of Bim not only in the adenomas but also in human CRC organoids that had lost responsiveness to TGF-{$\beta$}-induced apoptosis. However, wild-type intestinal crypts were markedly less sensitive to TGF-{$\beta$} than Apc-mutant adenomas, whereas the KRas oncogene increased resistance to TGF-{$\beta$} via the activation of the Erk1/2 kinase pathway, leading to Bim down-regulation. Our studies identify Bim as a critical mediator of TGF-{$\beta$}-induced apoptosis in intestinal adenomas and show that the common progression mutations modify Bim levels and sensitivity to TGF-{$\beta$} during intestinal adenoma development.},

  abstract = {The miR-200 family plays a crucial role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition via controlling cell migration and polarity. We hypothesized that miR-200b, one miR-200 family member, could regulate angiogenic responses via modulating endothelial cell migration. Delivery of the miR-200b mimic in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) suppressed the angiogenic response, whereas miR-200b-depleted HMECs exhibited elevated angiogenesis in vitro, as evidenced by Matrigel\textregistered{} tube formation and cell migration. Using in silico studies, miR target reporter assay, and Western blot analysis revealed that v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (Ets-1), a crucial angiogenesis-related transcription factor, serves as a novel direct target of miR-200b. Knocking down endogenous Ets-1 simulated an anti-angiogenic response of the miR-200b mimic-transfected cells. Certain Ets-1-associated genes, namely matrix metalloproteinase 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, were negatively regulated by miR-200b. Overexpression of Ets-1 rescued miR-200b-dependent impairment in angiogenic response and suppression of Ets-1-associated gene expression. Both hypoxia as well as HIF-1{$\alpha$} stabilization inhibited miR-200b expression and elevated Ets-1 expression. Experiments to identify how miR-200b modulates angiogenesis under a low oxygen environment illustrated that hypoxia-induced miR-200b down-regulation de-repressed Ets-1 expression to promote angiogenesis. This study provides the first evidence that hypoxia-sensitive miR-200b is involved in induction of angiogenesis via directly targeting Ets-1 in HMECs.},

  abstract = {Inactivating mutations of the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene, NF2, result predominantly in benign neurological tumors, schwannomas and meningiomas, in humans; however, mutations in murine Nf2 lead to a broad spectrum of cancerous tumors. The tumor-suppressive function of the NF2 protein, merlin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker, remains unclear. Here, we identify the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as a novel mediator of merlin's tumor suppressor activity. Merlin-deficient human meningioma cells and merlin knockdown arachnoidal cells, the nonneoplastic cell counterparts of meningiomas, exhibit rapamycin-sensitive constitutive mTORC1 activation and increased growth. NF2 patient tumors and Nf2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrate elevated mTORC1 signaling. Conversely, the exogenous expression of wild-type merlin isoforms, but not a patient-derived L64P mutant, suppresses mTORC1 signaling. Merlin does not regulate mTORC1 via the established mechanism of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated TSC2 inactivation and may instead regulate TSC/mTOR signaling in a novel fashion. In conclusion, the deregulation of mTORC1 activation underlies the aberrant growth and proliferation of NF2-associated tumors and may restrain the growth of these lesions through negative feedback mechanisms, suggesting that rapamycin in combination with phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors may be therapeutic for NF2.},

Microinjection of antibodies against subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) or against human Cdc20 (fizzy) arrested cells at metaphase and stabilized both cyclins A and B1. Cyclin A was efficiently polyubiquitylated by Cdc20 or Cdh1-activated APC/C in vitro, but in contrast to cyclin B1, the proteolysis of cyclin A was not delayed by the spindle assembly checkpoint. The degradation of cyclin B1 was accelerated by inhibition of the spindle assembly checkpoint.

Histone acetylation and DNA methylation are epigenetic modifications whose patterns can be regarded as heritable marks that ensure accurate transmission of the chromatin states and gene expression profiles over many cell generations. Importantly, patterns and levels of DNA methylation and histone acetylation are profoundly altered in human cancers. Accumulating evidence suggests that an epigenetic cross-talk, i.e. interplay between DNA methylation and histone acetylation, may be involved in the process of gene transcription and aberrant gene silencing in tumours. Although the molecular mechanism of gene activation is relatively well understood, the hierarchical order of events and dependencies leading to gene silencing in the course of cancer development remain largely unknown. While some studies suggest that DNA methylation patterns guide histone modifications (including histone acetylation and methylation) during gene silencing, other studies argue that DNA methylation takes its cues primarily from histone modification states. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the interplay between DNA methylation and histone modifications during gene silencing and its importance in the integration of environmental and intrinsic stimuli in the control of gene expression. We also discuss the importance of an epigenetic cross-talk in the protection against genetic changes in response to environmental genotoxins as well as the implication for cancer therapy and prevention.},

Prolonged or persistent arrest in the activated GTP-loaded state by mutation of Ras as in lung cancer or in a Ras-GTPase-activating protein as in neurofibromatosis type 1 promotes tumorigenesis. We now show that the tumor-suppressor protein merlin (mutated in neurofibromatosis type 2) also controls Ras activity. Systematic analysis of growth factor signaling located the step of merlin interference to the activation of Ras and Rac. Merlin independently uncouples both Ras and Rac from growth factor signals. In the case of Ras, merlin acts downstream of the receptor tyrosine kinase-growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2)-SOS complex. However, merlin does not bind either SOS or Ras, but it counteracts the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin)-dependent activation of Ras, which correlates with the formation of a complex comprising ERM proteins, Grb2, SOS, Ras, and filamentous actin. Because efficient signaling from Ras requires Rac-p21-activated kinase-dependent phosphorylations of Raf and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, merlin can also inhibit signal transfer from dominantly active Ras mutants. We propose that the interference of merlin with Ras- and Rac-dependent signal transfer represents part of the tumor-suppressive action of merlin.},

These include Robo4 (roundabout 4), CLEC14A (C-type lectin 14A) and ECSCR (endothelial cell-specific chemotaxis regulator) [formerly known as ECSM2 (endothelial cell-specific molecule 2)]. Loss of laminar shear stress induces Robo4 and CLEC14A expression and an endothelial 'tip cell' phenotype. Low shear stress is found not only at sites of vascular occlusion such as thrombosis and embolism, but also in the poorly structured vessels that populate solid tumours. The latter probably accounts for strong expression of Robo4 and CLEC14A on tumour vessels. The function of Robo4 has, in the past, aroused controversy. However, the recent identification of Unc5B as a Robo4 ligand has increased our understanding and we hypothesize that Robo4 function is context-dependent. ECSCR is another endothelial-specific protein that promotes filopodia formation and migration, but, in this case, expression is independent of shear stress. We discuss recent papers describing ECSCR, including intracellular signalling pathways, and briefly contrast these with signalling by Robo4.},

APC/C(Cdc20) is active during mitosis and promotes anaphase onset by targeting mitotic cyclins and securin. APC/C(Cdh1) becomes active during mitotic exit and has essential targets in G1 phase. It is not known whether targeting of substrates by APC/C(Cdh1) plays any role in the final stages of mitosis. Here, we have investigated the role of APC/C(Cdh1) at this time in the cell cycle by using siRNA-mediated depletion of Cdh1 in human cells. RESULTS: In contrast to the current view that Cdh1 takes over from Cdc20 at anaphase, we show that reduced Cdh1 levels have no effect on destruction of many APC/C substrates during mitotic exit but strongly and specifically stabilize Aurora kinases. We find that APC/C(Cdh1) is required for assembly of a robust spindle midzone at anaphase and for normal timings of spindle elongation and cytokinesis. The effect of Cdh1 siRNA on anaphase spindle dynamics requires Aurora A, and its effect can be mimicked by nondegradable Aurora kinase. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting of Aurora kinases at anaphase by APC/C(Cdh1) participates in the control of mitotic exit and cytokinesis.},

  abstract = {We recently proposed a detailed model describing the dynamics of the network of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) driving the mammalian cell cycle (G\'erard and Goldbeter, 2009). The model contains four modules, each centered around one cyclin/Cdk complex. Cyclin D/Cdk4-6 and cyclin E/Cdk2 promote progression in G1 and elicit the G1/S transition, respectively; cyclin A/Cdk2 ensures progression in S and the transition S/G2, while the activity of cyclin B/Cdk1 brings about the G2/M transition. This model shows that in the presence of sufficient amounts of growth factor the Cdk network is capable of temporal self-organization in the form of sustained oscillations, which correspond to the ordered, sequential activation of the various cyclin/Cdk complexes that control the successive phases of the cell cycle. The results suggest that the switch from cellular quiescence to cell proliferation corresponds to the transition from a stable steady state to sustained oscillations in the Cdk network. The transition depends on a finely tuned balance between factors that promote or hinder progression in the cell cycle. We show that the transition from quiescence to proliferation can occur in multiple ways that alter this balance. By resorting to bifurcation diagrams, we analyze the mechanism of oscillations in the Cdk network. Finally, we show that the complexity of the detailed model can be greatly reduced, without losing its key dynamical properties, by considering a skeleton model for the Cdk network. Using such a skeleton model for the mammalian cell cycle we show that positive feedback (PF) loops enhance the amplitude and the robustness of Cdk oscillations with respect to molecular noise. We compare the relative merits of the detailed and skeleton versions of the model for the Cdk network driving the mammalian cell cycle.},

  abstract = {The timing of DNA synthesis, mitosis and cell division is regulated by a complex network of biochemical reactions that control the activities of a family of cyclin-dependent kinases. The temporal dynamics of this reaction network is typically modeled by nonlinear differential equations describing the rates of the component reactions. This approach provides exquisite details about molecular regulatory processes but is hampered by the need to estimate realistic values for the many kinetic constants that determine the reaction rates. It is difficult to estimate these kinetic constants from available experimental data. To avoid this problem, modelers often resort to 'qualitative' modeling strategies, such as Boolean switching networks, but these models describe only the coarsest features of cell cycle regulation. In this paper we describe a hybrid approach that combines the best features of continuous differential equations and discrete Boolean networks. Cyclin abundances are tracked by piecewise linear differential equations for cyclin synthesis and degradation. Cyclin synthesis is regulated by transcription factors whose activities are represented by discrete variables (0 or 1) and likewise for the activities of the ubiquitin-ligating enzyme complexes that govern cyclin degradation. The discrete variables change according to a predetermined sequence, with the times between transitions determined in part by cyclin accumulation and degradation and as well by exponentially distributed random variables. The model is evaluated in terms of flow cytometry measurements of cyclin proteins in asynchronous populations of human cell lines. The few kinetic constants in the model are easily estimated from the experimental data. Using this hybrid approach, modelers can quickly create quantitatively accurate, computational models of protein regulatory networks in cells.},

Using live cell imaging techniques, we showed here that Bax underwent four distinct stages of dynamic redistribution during UV-induced apoptosis. At stage I, Bax was distributed diffusely in the cytosol. About an hour after UV treatment at stage II, Bax started to translocate to mitochondria and distributed uniformly at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). Within a few minutes, at stage III, Bax and Bak began to form small complexes at the MOM. Later, at stage IV, these Bax and Bak complexes expanded to become large clusters. We found that the formation of Bax-Bak small complexes at stage III was responsible for permeabilizing the MOM to release cytochrome c and Smac. Using a FRET technique, we further showed that Bax binds to Bak within the complex formed at the MOM during stage III. Finally, using a quantitative fluorescence measurement, we determined that the Bax-Bak complex was about 0.25 microm wide and composed of more than 100 protein molecules. These findings suggest that the Bax-Bak structure responsible for releasing mitochondrial proteins during apoptosis is not channel-like.},

At the molecular level, this involves interactions with E-box (CACC/GGTG) consensus elements within target gene promoters to achieve transcriptional repression. However, precise elucidation of events involved in this DNA recognition and binding of specific promoters to regulate target genes have not been achieved. In the present study, we show that besides transcriptional repression, Slug can also directly activate its own expression by preferential binding to specific E-box elements in the distal binding region of its promoter. Our findings suggest that while the first ZF does not contribute to the transcription-associated functions of Slug, all the remaining four ZFs are involved in regulating the expression of target genes with ZF3 and ZF4 being more crucial than ZF2 or ZF5. We also report that recognition and binding preferences of ZFs are defined through intrinsic differences in the E-box core base pairs and/or flanking sequences, with the S2 E-box element being most critical during autoregulation. However, specific target E-box recognition and binding are also defined by the cellular context, which implies that in silico and/or biochemical DNA binding preferences may not necessarily be able to accurately predict in situ events. Our studies thus constitute a novel understanding of transcriptional regulation.},

In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survive-a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding 'fractional killing' of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general.},

Type IV collagen exists in a highly complex suprastructure form and recent studies implicate that protomer (the trimeric building unit of type IV collagen) assembly is mediated by the NC1 domain present in the C-terminus of each collagen alpha-chain polypeptide. Here we show that type IV collagen contributes to the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype of proximal tubular epithelial cells, whereas type I collagen promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT). In addition, the recombinant human alpha1NC1 domain inhibits assembly of type IV collagen NC1 hexamers and potentially disrupts the deposition of type IV collagen, facilitating EMT in vitro. Inhibition of type IV collagen assembly by the alpha1NC1 domain up-regulates the production of transforming growth factor-beta1 in proximal tubular epithelial cells, an inducer of EMT. These results strongly suggest that basement membrane architecture is pivotal for the maintenance of epithelial phenotype and that changes in basement membrane architecture potentially lead to up-regulation of transforming growth factor-beta1, which contributes to EMT during renal fibrosis.},

Chk1 phosphorylation targets Cdc25A for destruction and, as shown here, inhibits interactions between Cdc25A and its mitotic substrate cyclin B1-Cdk1. Phosphorylation of Cdc25A on serine 178 and threonine 507 facilitates 14-3-3 binding, and Chk1 phosphorylates both residues in vitro. Mutation of T507 to alanine (T507A) enhanced the biological activity of Cdc25A. Cdc25A(T507A) was more efficient in binding to cyclin B1, activating cyclin B1-Cdk1, and promoting premature entry into mitosis.

In NMuMG mammary epithelial cells, exogenous TGFbeta1 induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Akt in vitro kinase activity against GSK-3beta within 30 min. These responses were temporally correlated with delocalization of E-cadherin, ZO-1, and integrin beta(1) from cell junctions and the acquisition of spindle cell morphology. LY294002, an inhibitor of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, and a dominant-negative mutant of Akt blocked the delocalization of ZO-1 induced by TGFbeta1, whereas transfection of constitutively active p110 induced loss of ZO-1 from tight junctions. In addition, LY294002 blocked TGFbeta-mediated C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2. Consistent with these data, TGFbeta-induced p3TP-Lux and p(CAGA)(12)-Lux reporter activities were inhibited by LY294002 and transiently expressed dominant-negative p85 and Akt mutants in NMuMG and 4T1 cells. Dominant-negative RhoA inhibited TGFbeta-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473, whereas constitutively active RhoA increased the basal phosphorylation of Akt, suggesting that RhoA in involved in TGFbeta-induced EMT. Finally, LY294002 and neutralizing TGFbeta1 antibodies inhibited ligand-independent constitutively active Akt as well as basal and TGFbeta-stimulated migration in 4T1 and EMT6 breast tumor cells. Taken together, these data suggest that PI3K-Akt signaling is required for TGFbeta-induced transcriptional responses, EMT, and cell migration.},

While the importance of the protein abundance of EMT-inducers, such as Snail (SNAI1) and Zeb1 (ZEB1), during EMT progression is clear, the reciprocal interactions between the untranslated regions (UTRs) of EMT-inducers via a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network have received little attention. In this study, we found a synchronized transcript abundance of Snail and Zeb1 mediated by a non-coding RNA network in colorectal cancer (CRC). Importantly, the trans-regulatory ceRNA network in the UTRs of EMT inducers is mediated by competition between tumor suppressive miRNA-34 (miR-34) and miRNA-200 (miR-200). Furthermore, the ceRNA network consisting of the UTRs of EMT inducers and tumor suppressive miRs is functional in the EMT phenotype and therapeutic resistance of colon cancer. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples, we also found genome-wide ceRNA gene sets regulated by miR-34a and miR-200 in colorectal cancer. These results indicate that the ceRNA networks regulated by the reciprocal interaction between EMT gene UTRs and tumor suppressive miRs are functional in CRC progression and therapeutic resistance.},

  abstract = {Pitx2, Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling, and microRNAs (miRs) play a critical role in the regulation of dental stem cells during embryonic development. In this report, we have identified a Pitx2:{$\beta$}-catenin regulatory pathway involved in epithelial cell differentiation and conversion of mesenchymal cells to amelogenin expressing epithelial cells via miR-200a. Pitx2 and {$\beta$}-catenin are expressed in the labial incisor cervical loop or epithelial stem cell niche, with decreased expression in the differentiating ameloblast cells of the mouse lower incisor. Bioinformatics analyses reveal that miR-200a-3p expression is activated in the pre-ameloblast cells to enhance epithelial cell differentiation. We demonstrate that Pitx2 activates miR-200a-3p expression and miR-200a-3p reciprocally represses Pitx2 and {$\beta$}-catenin expression. Pitx2 and {$\beta$}-catenin interact to synergistically activate gene expression during odontogenesis and miR-200a-3p attenuates their expression and directs differentiation. To understand how this mechanism controls cell differentiation and cell fate, oral epithelial and odontoblast mesenchymal cells were reprogrammed by a two-step induction method using Pitx2 and miR-200a-3p. Conversion to amelogenin expressing dental epithelial cells involved an up-regulation of the stem cell marker Sox2 and proliferation genes and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers. E-cadherin expression was increased as well as ameloblast specific factors. The combination of Pitx2, a regulator of dental stem cells and miR-200a converts mesenchymal cells to a fully differentiated dental epithelial cell type. This pathway and reprogramming can be used to reprogram mesenchymal or oral epithelial cells to dental epithelial (ameloblast) cells, which can be used in tissue repair and regeneration studies.},

  abstract = {Lithium has been used as an effective mood-stabilizing drug for the treatment of manic episodes and depression for 50 years. More recently, lithium has been found to protect neurons from death induced by a wide array of neurotoxic insults. However, the molecular basis for the prophylactic effects of lithium have remained obscure. A target of lithium, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), is implicated in neuronal death after trophic deprivation. The mechanism whereby GSK-3 exerts its neurotoxic effects is also unknown. Here we show that lithium blocks the canonical c-Jun apoptotic pathway in cerebellar granule neurons deprived of trophic support. This effect is mimicked by the structurally independent inhibitors of GSK-3, FRAT1, and indirubin. Like lithium, these prevent the stress induced c-Jun protein increase and subsequent apoptosis. These events are downstream of c-Jun transactivation, since GSK-3 inhibitors block neuronal death induced by constitutively active c-Jun (Ser/Thr--{$>$}Asp) and FRAT1 expression inhibits AP1 reporter activity. Consistent with this, AP1-dependent expression of proapoptotic Bim requires GSK-3-like activity. These data suggest that a GSK-3-like kinase acts in tandem with c-Jun N-terminal kinase to coordinate the full execution of the c-Jun stress response and neuronal death in response to trophic deprivation.},

The cytostatic effect of p53 is mediated by transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21(Cip1), whereas the apoptotic effect is mediated by transcriptional activation of mediators including PUMA and PIG3 (ref. 2). What determines the choice between cytostasis and apoptosis is not clear. Here we show that the transcription factor Myc is a principal determinant of this choice. Myc is directly recruited to the p21(Cip1) promoter by the DNA-binding protein Miz-1. This interaction blocks p21(Cip1) induction by p53 and other activators. As a result Myc switches, from cytostatic to apoptotic, the p53-dependent response of colon cancer cells to DNA damage. Myc does not modify the ability of p53 to bind to the p21(Cip1) or PUMA promoters, but selectively inhibits bound p53 from activating p21(Cip1) transcription. By inhibiting p21(Cip1) expression Myc favours the initiation of apoptosis, thereby influencing the outcome of a p53 response in favour of cell death.},

  abstract = {Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases and in cancer therapy. Although the unfolded protein response is known to alleviate ER stress by reducing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, the exact survival elements and their downstream signaling pathways that directly counteract ER stress-stimulated apoptotic signaling remain elusive. Here, we have shown that endogenous Akt and ERK are rapidly activated and act as downstream effectors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in thapsigargin- or tunicamycin-induced ER stress. Introduction of either dominant-negative Akt or MEK1 or the inhibitors LY294002 and U0126 sensitized cells to ER stress-induced cell death in different cell types. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of gene expression during ER stress revealed that cIAP-2 and XIAP, members of the IAP family of potent caspase suppressors, were strongly induced. Transcription of cIAP-2 and XIAP was up-regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway as shown by its reversal by dominant-negative Akt or LY294002. Ablation of these IAPs by RNA interference sensitized cells to ER stress-induced death, which was reversed by the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone. The protective role of IAPs in ER stress coincided with Smac release from mitochondria to the cytosol. Furthermore, it was shown that mTOR was not required for Akt-mediated survival. These results represent the first demonstration that activation of endogenous Akt/IAPs and MEK/ERK plays a critical role in controlling cell survival by resisting ER stress-induced cell death signaling.},

This might be explained by associations of vWF with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. Methods and Results We tested whether vWF predicted incident CVD in 3,799 Framingham Offspring Study participants, and in particular, among those with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance. During 11 years of follow-up, 351 participants developed CVD. In proportional hazards models (adjusting for age, sex, blood pressure, smoking, body mass index, total and HDL cholesterol, treatment with aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive and lipid lowering medication) using the lowest quartile of the vWF distribution as the referent, the hazard ratio (HR) for CVD was 0.94 in the second quartile, 0.98 in the third, and 1.32 in the highest (P= 0.04 for trend). Additional adjustment for type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance (homeostasis model, HOMA-IR) partially attenuated the association (multivariable HRs for top quartile 1.28 and 1.21, respectively). We then stratified the models by diabetes status or HOMA-IR distribution (top quartile versus lower three). vWF was associated with CVD among participants with diabetes (HR, top quartile relative to bottom 1.47, P = 0.04 for trend) but not among non-diabetics (HR 1.15, P = 0.5) and similarly among insulin resistant (HR 1.50, P = 0.01) but not insulin sensitive participants (HR 1.02, P = 0.9). Conclusions Higher levels of vWF were associated with risk of CVD in people with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance, suggesting that vWF may be a risk factor unique to these populations.},

  abstract = {Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental process hijacked by cancer cells to leave the primary tumor site, invade surrounding tissue, and establish distant metastases. A hallmark of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin expression, and one major signal for the induction of EMT is TGF{$\beta$}, which is dysregulated in up to 40\% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have constructed an EMT network of 70 nodes and 135 edges by integrating the signaling pathways involved in developmental EMT and known dysregulations in invasive HCC. We then used discrete dynamic modeling to understand the dynamics of the EMT network driven by TGF{$\beta$}. Our network model recapitulates known dysregulations during the induction of EMT and predicts the activation of the Wnt and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathways during this process. We show, across multiple murine (P2E and P2M) and human HCC cell lines (Huh7, PLC/PRF/5, HLE, and HLF), that the TGF{$\beta$} signaling axis is a conserved driver of mesenchymal phenotype HCC and confirm that Wnt and SHH signaling are induced in these cell lines. Furthermore, we identify by network analysis eight regulatory feedback motifs that stabilize the EMT process and show that these motifs involve cross-talk among multiple major pathways. Our model will be useful in identifying potential therapeutic targets for the suppression of EMT, invasion, and metastasis in HCC.},

Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining of tissue arrays has shown that CLEC14A is strongly expressed in tumor vasculature when compared with vessels in normal tissue. CLEC14A overexpression in tumor vessels was seen in a wide range of solid tumor types. Functional studies showed that CLEC14A induces filopodia and facilitates endothelial migration, tube formation and vascular development in zebrafish that is, CLEC14A regulates pro-angiogenic phenotypes. CLEC14A antisera inhibited cell migration and tube formation, suggesting that anti-CLEC14A antibodies may have anti-angiogenic activity. Finally, in endothelial cultures, expression of CLEC14A increased at low shear stress, and we hypothesize that low shear stress due to poor blood flow in the disorganized tumor vasculature induces expression of CLEC14A on tumor vessels and pro-angiogenic phenotypes.},

However, it is unclear whether EMT itself or specific EMT regulators play causal roles in these properties. Here we identify an EMT-inducing transcription factor, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), as a regulator of radiosensitivity and DNA damage response. Radioresistant subpopulations of breast cancer cells derived from ionizing radiation exhibit hyperactivation of the kinase ATM and upregulation of ZEB1, and the latter promotes tumour cell radioresistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ATM phosphorylates and stabilizes ZEB1 in response to DNA damage, ZEB1 in turn directly interacts with USP7 and enhances its ability to deubiquitylate and stabilize CHK1, thereby promoting homologous recombination-dependent DNA repair and resistance to radiation. These findings identify ZEB1 as an ATM substrate linking ATM to CHK1 and the mechanism underlying the association between EMT and radioresistance.},

The physiological relevance and mechanism of TGF-beta-mediated apoptosis induction in these cells remains to be determined. Here we demonstrate the requirement for TGF-beta-mediated regulation of BIK and BCL-X(L) to activate an intrinsic apoptotic pathway in centroblastic BL cells. TGF-beta directly induced transcription of BIK and a consensus Smad-binding element identified in the BIK promoter recruits TGF-beta-activated Smad transcription factor complexes in vivo. TGF-beta also transcriptionally repressed expression of the apoptosis inhibitor BCL-X(L). Inhibition of BCL-X(L) sensitised BL cells to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis whereas overexpression of BCL-X(L) or suppression of BIK by shRNA, diminished TGF-beta-induced apoptosis. BIK and BCL-X(L) were also identified as TGF-beta target genes in purified normal human centroblast B cells and immunohistochemical analyses of tonsil tissue revealed widespread TGF-beta receptor-regulated Smad activation and a focal pattern of BIK expression. Furthermore, using a selective inhibitor of the TGF-beta receptor we provide evidence that autocrine TGF-beta signalling through ALK5 contributes to the default apoptotic programme in normal human centroblasts undergoing spontaneous apoptosis. Our data suggests that TGF-beta may act as a physiological mediator of human germinal centre homoeostasis by regulation of BIK and BCL-X(L).},

Lamellipodial protrusions are also activated by the rapid growth of a disorganized array of very short microtubules induced by the microtubule-stabilizing drug taxol. Thus, neither microtubule shortening nor long-range microtubule-based intracellular transport is required for activating protrusion. We suggest that the growth phase of microtubule dynamic instability at leading-edge lamellipodia locally activates Rac1 to drive actin polymerization and lamellipodial protrusion required for cell migration.},

Here we show that beta-catenin and Lef1/Tcf, which are downstream components of the Wnt signalling cascade, form a complex with Smad4, an essential mediator of signals initiated by members of the TGF-beta growth factor superfamily. In Xenopus, this interaction directly and synergistically affects expression of the twin (Xtwn) gene during formation of the organizer.

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 (Esm1) is a secreted protein thought to play a role in angiogenesis and inflammation. However, there is currently no direct in vivo evidence supporting a function of Esm1 in either of these processes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of Esm1 in vivo and the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated and analyzed Esm1 knockout (Esm1(KO)) mice to study its role in angiogenesis and inflammation. Esm1 expression is induced by the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in endothelial tip cells of the mouse retina. Esm1(KO) mice showed delayed vascular outgrowth and reduced filopodia extension, which are both VEGF-A-dependent processes. Impairment of Esm1 function led to a decrease in phosphorylated Erk1/2 (extracellular-signal regulated kinases 1/2) in sprouting vessels. We also found that Esm1(KO) mice displayed a 40\% decrease in leukocyte transmigration. Moreover, VEGF-induced vascular permeability was decreased by 30\% in Esm1(KO) mice and specifically on stimulation with VEGF-A165 but not VEGF-A121. Accordingly, cerebral edema attributable to ischemic stroke-induced vascular permeability was reduced by 50\% in the absence of Esm1. Mechanistically, we show that Esm1 binds directly to Fibronectin and thereby displaces Fibronectin-bound VEGF-A165 leading to increased bioavailability of VEGF-A165 and subsequently enhanced levels of VEGF-A signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Esm1 is simultaneously a target and modulator of VEGF signaling in endothelial cells, playing a role in angiogenesis, inflammation, and vascular permeability, which might be of potential interest for therapeutic applications.},

A major challenge is to disentangle these two types of variability and to understand the dynamic processes and mechanisms that control them. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provide an ideal model system to address this issue because they exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic expression of functionally important regulatory factors. We analyzed gene expression in individual ESCs using single-molecule RNA-FISH and quantitative time-lapse movies. These data discriminated stochastic switching between two coherent (correlated) gene expression states and burst-like transcriptional noise. We further showed that the "2i" signaling pathway inhibitors modulate both types of variation. Finally, we found that DNA methylation plays a key role in maintaining these metastable states. Together, these results show how ESC gene expression states and dynamics arise from a combination of intrinsic noise, coherent cellular states, and epigenetic regulation.},

Each cell has a limited, but distinctive, sensory capacity and shares information with neighbours so that sensing is distributed among cells. Communication of information among connected cells provides system-level sensing substantially greater than the capabilities of any single cell and, as a collective, the endothelium solves sensory problems too complex for any single cell.},

  abstract = {Increased glucose catabolism and resistance to cell death are hallmarks of cancers, but the link between them remains elusive. Remarkably, under conditions where caspases are inhibited, the process of cell death is delayed but rarely blocked, leading to the occurrence of caspase-independent cell death (CICD). Escape from CICD is particularly relevant in the context of cancer as apoptosis inhibition only is often not sufficient to allow oncogenic transformation. While most glycolytic enzymes are overexpressed in tumors, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is of particular interest as it can allow cells to recover from CICD. Here, we show that GAPDH, but no other glycolytic enzymes tested, when overexpressed could bind to active Akt and limit its dephosphorylation. Active Akt prevents FoxO nuclear localization, which precludes Bcl-6 expression and leads to Bcl-xL overexpression. The GAPDH-dependent Bcl-xL overexpression is able to protect a subset of mitochondria from permeabilization that are required for cellular survival from CICD. Thus, our work suggests that GAPDH overexpression could induce Bcl-xL overexpression and protect cells from CICD-induced chemotherapy through preservation of intact mitochondria that may facilitate tumor survival and chemotherapeutic resistance.},

In the present study, the Raf-1, MEK, and ERK activities were concomitantly decreased in fibroblasts, which inhibit morphological transformation and proliferation by Axin induction. The inhibition of the components of the ERK pathway by Axin occurred in cells retaining wild-type beta-catenin, including primary hepatocytes, but not in cells retaining non-degradable mutant beta-catenin. Axin inhibits cellular proliferation and ERK pathway activation induced by either epidermal growth factor or Ras, indicating a role of Axin in the regulation of growth induced by ERK pathway activation. ERK pathway regulation by Axin occurs at least partly via reduction of the protein level of Ras. Both wild-type and mutant Ras proteins are subjected to regulation by Axin, which occurs in cells retaining wild-type but not mutant beta-catenin gene. The role of beta-catenin in the regulation of the Ras-ERK pathway was further confirmed by Ras reduction and subsequent inhibitions of the ERK pathway components by knock down of mutated form of beta-catenin. The Ras regulation by Axin was blocked by treatment of leupeptin, an inhibitor of the lysosomal protein degradation machinery. Overall, Axin inhibits proliferation of cells at least partly by reduction of Ras protein level via beta-catenin. This study provides evidences for the role of the Ras-ERK pathway in carcinogenesis caused by mutations of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway components.},

The stiffness of the extracellular matrix can be changed by disease or injury. In damaged blood vessels, the extracellular matrix becomes stiffer around the site of damage; the smooth muscle cells that surround blood vessels migrate and proliferate to repair the damage. Bae               et al.               identified a signaling pathway that included the enzyme Rac and the cell migration protein lamellipodin, and that triggered proliferation in cells growing on surfaces that mimicked very stiff extracellular matrix. Mice that lacked Rac in their smooth muscle cells did not efficiently repair damage to blood vessels. Thus, lamellipodin is important in not only regulating cellular migration, but also the cell cycle in response to mechanical cues from the extracellular matrix.                        ,              Tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness is transduced into intracellular stiffness, signaling, and changes in cellular behavior. Integrins and several of their associated focal adhesion proteins have been implicated in sensing ECM stiffness. We investigated how an initial sensing event is translated into intracellular stiffness and a biologically interpretable signal. We found that a pathway consisting of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), the adaptor protein p130Cas (Cas), and the guanosine triphosphatase Rac selectively transduced ECM stiffness into stable intracellular stiffness, increased the abundance of the cell cycle protein cyclin D1, and promoted S-phase entry. Rac-dependent intracellular stiffening involved its binding partner lamellipodin, a protein that transmits Rac signals to the cytoskeleton during cell migration. Our findings establish that mechanotransduction by a FAK-Cas-Rac-lamellipodin signaling module converts the external information encoded by ECM stiffness into stable intracellular stiffness and mechanosensitive cell cycling. Thus, lamellipodin is important not only in controlling cellular migration but also for regulating the cell cycle in response to mechanical signals.},

Here, we showed that Necl-5 interacted with Sprouty2, known to be a negative regulator of growth factor-induced signaling, and reduced the inhibitory effect of Sprouty2 on PDGF-induced Ras signaling. Necl-5 was reported to be down-regulated by its trans-interaction with nectin-3 upon cell-cell contact, initiating cooperative cell-cell adhesion with cadherin. This down-regulation of Necl-5 caused tyrosine phosphorylation of Sprouty2 by c-Src, which was activated by PDGF receptor in response to PDGF, and inhibited PDGF-induced Ras signaling. Thus, Necl-5 and Sprouty2 cooperatively regulate PDGF-induced Ras signaling. The roles of Necl-5 and Sprouty2 in contact inhibition for cell proliferation are also discussed.},

Since epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the acquisition of cancer stem cell traits are important for cancer onset and progression, we sought to determine the role of AUF1 in these two important processes. We have shown that AUF1 induces EMT and stemness in breast epithelial cells via stabilization of the SNAIL1 and TWIST1 mRNAs, and their consequent upregulation. Indeed, AUF1 binds the transcripts of these two genes at their 3'UTR and reduces their turnover. Ectopic expression of AUF1 also promoted stemness in mammary epithelial cells, and thereby increased the proportion of cancer stem cells. Importantly, breast cancer cells that ectopically express AUF1 were more efficient in forming orthotopic tumor xenografts in nude mice than their corresponding controls with limiting cell inocula. On the other hand, AUF1 downregulation with specific siRNA inhibited EMT and reduced the stemness features in breast cancer cells. Moreover, AUF1 knockdown sensitized breast cancer cells to the killing effect of cisplatin. Together, these findings provide clear evidence that AUF1 is an important inducer of the EMT process through stabilization of SNAIL1 and TWIST1 and the consequent promotion of breast cancer stem cells. Thereby, AUF1 targeted molecules could constitute efficient therapeutics for breast cancer patients.},

We have found that components of focal adhesions including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, and p130(CAS) (CAS) are serine/threonine phosphorylated during mitosis when all three proteins are tyrosine dephosphorylated. Mitosis-specific phosphorylation continues past cytokinesis and is reversed during post-mitotic cell spreading. We have found two significant alterations in FAK-mediated signal transduction during mitosis. First, the association of FAK with CAS or c-Src is greatly inhibited, with levels decreasing to 16 and 13\% of the interphase levels, respectively. Second, mitotic FAK shows decreased binding to a peptide mimicking the cytoplasmic domain of beta-integrin when compared with FAK of interphase cells. Mitosis-specific phosphorylation is responsible for the disruption of FAK/CAS binding because dephosphorylation of mitotic FAK in vitro by protein serine/threonine phosphatase 1 restores the ability of FAK to associate with CAS, though not with c-Src. These results suggest that mitosis-specific modification of FAK uncouples signal transduction pathways involving integrin, CAS, and c-Src, and may maintain FAK in an inactive state until post-mitotic spreading.},

  abstract = {The regulation of blood vessel formation is of fundamental importance to many physiological processes, and angiogenesis is a major area for novel therapeutic approaches to diseases from ischemia to cancer. A poorly understood clinical manifestation of pathological angiogenesis is angiodysplasia, vascular malformations that cause severe gastrointestinal bleeding. Angiodysplasia can be associated with von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common bleeding disorder in man. VWD is caused by a defect or deficiency in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein essential for normal hemostasis that is involved in inflammation. We hypothesized that VWF regulates angiogenesis. Inhibition of VWF expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in endothelial cells (ECs) caused increased in vitro angiogenesis and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)-dependent proliferation and migration, coupled to decreased integrin {$\alpha$}v{$\beta$}3 levels and increased angiopoietin (Ang)-2 release. ECs expanded from blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells of VWD patients confirmed these results. Finally, 2 different approaches, in situ and in vivo, showed increased vascularization in VWF-deficient mice. We therefore identify a new function of VWF in ECs, which confirms VWF as a protein with multiple vascular roles and defines a novel link between hemostasis and angiogenesis. These results may have important consequences for the management of VWD, with potential therapeutic implications for vascular diseases.},

Here we identify a rare transient cell population within mouse ES and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell cultures that expresses high levels of transcripts found in two-cell (2C) embryos in which the blastomeres are totipotent. We genetically tagged these 2C-like ES cells and show that they lack the inner cell mass pluripotency proteins Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2 and Nanog, and have acquired the ability to contribute to both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. We show that nearly all ES cells cycle in and out of this privileged state, which is partially controlled by histone-modifying enzymes. Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic analyses showed that many 2C transcripts are initiated from long terminal repeats derived from endogenous retroviruses, suggesting this foreign sequence has helped to drive cell-fate regulation in placental mammals.},

Not surprisingly, the study of phenotypic plasticity is innately interdisciplinary and encompasses aspects of behavior, development, ecology, evolution, genetics, genomics, and multiple physiological systems at various levels of biological organization. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, phenotypic plasticity may be a powerful means of adaptation and dramatic examples of phenotypic plasticity include predator avoidance, insect wing polymorphisms, the timing of metamorphosis in amphibians, osmoregulation in fishes, and alternative reproductive tactics in male vertebrates. From a human health perspective, documented examples of plasticity most commonly include the results of exercise, training, and/or dieting on human morphology and physiology. Regardless of the discipline, phenotypic plasticity has increasingly become the target of a plethora of investigations with the methodological approaches utilized ranging from the molecular to whole organsimal. In this article, we provide a brief historical outlook on phenotypic plasticity; examine its potential adaptive significance; emphasize recent molecular approaches that provide novel insight into underlying mechanisms, and highlight examples in fishes and insects. Finally, we highlight examples of phenotypic plasticity from a human health perspective and underscore the use of mouse models as a powerful tool in understanding the genetic architecture of phenotypic plasticity.},

In contrast, cell death induced by the short splice variant of Bcl-x depends on Bak but not Bax. This indicates that Bak is functional but fails to become activated by Nbk. Here, we show that binding of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) to Bak persists after Nbk expression and inhibits Nbk-induced apoptosis in Bax-deficient cells. In contrast, the BH3-only protein Puma disrupts Mcl-1-Bak interaction and triggers cell death via both Bax and Bak. Targeted knockdown of Mcl-1 overcomes inhibition of Bak and allows for Bak activation by Nbk. Thus, Nbk is held in check by Mcl-1 that interferes with activation of Bak. The finding that different BH3-only proteins rely specifically on Bax, Bak, or both has important implications for the design of anticancer drugs targeting Bcl-2.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death in men. Elevated expression of the transcription factor FoxM1 and c-Myc has been identified in prostate cancer. However, the potential mechanism of elevated FoxM1 and c-Myc to the development of prostate cancer has not been identified. METHODS: In this report, the mRNA level of FoxM1 and c-Myc was detected in 30 prostate cancer and para-cancer tissues. Then, we detected the expression level of FoxM1 by real-time PCR and Western blot after disturbance of the expression level of c-Myc in PC-3 cells. Whether c-Myc could bind to FoxM1 promoter was identified by ChIP assay. Finally, the migratory, invasive, and proliferative abilities in FoxM1 overexpressing and silencing PC-3 cells were detected by wound healing, transwell assay, CCK-8 assays, and Ki-67 protein level. RESULTS: We found that the expression level of FoxM1 and c-Myc were both increased in prostate cancer samples compared with para-cancer samples. The expression level of FoxM1 was changed consistent with the protein level of c-Myc. ChIP assay detected the direct binding of c-Myc in FoxM1 gene promoter. Lastly, overexpression of FoxM1 increased the migratory, invasive, and proliferative abilities of PC-3 cells, and its downregulation significantly decreased the migratory, invasive, and proliferative abilities. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, FoxM1 was significantly increased in prostate cancer samples, and it could regulate the proliferative and invasive ability of prostate cancer cells which might be a new target for prostate cancer. Besides, c-Myc could regulate the expression level of FoxM1 by directly binding to its gene promoter.},

These preparations, termed H\"autchen, were immunolabelled with antibodies to angiotensin II, endothelin and Factor-VIII-related antigen, and visualised by an avidin/biotin peroxidase complex. Clusters of cells, which accounted for approximately 30\% of the total endothelial cell population, and which were positively immunostained for angiotensin II, were found perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the aorta and femoral artery. Cells in the pulmonary artery were immunonegative for angiotensin II. The majority of cells in all three vessels were immunopositive for endothelin; groups of intensely stained cells were present in both the femoral artery and aorta, but not in the pulmonary artery. Immunoreactivity to Factor-VIII-related antigen was heterogeneous, with intensely stained amorphous patches of endothelial cells present in the femoral artery and aorta. H\"autchen preparations present an opportunity for the investigation of endothelial cell heterogeneity, both within and between vessels; this may provide a basis for the interpretation of the heterogeneity of endothelium-dependent responses in vessels of differing origin.},

So far, however, it has been used mainly in materials science applications. Here, we took advantage of helium ion microscopy to explore the epithelium of the rat kidney with unsurpassed image quality and detail. In addition, we evaluated different tissue preparation methods for their ability to preserve tissue architecture. We found that high contrast, high resolution imaging of the renal tubule surface is possible with a relatively simple processing procedure that consists of transcardial perfusion with aldehyde fixatives, vibratome tissue sectioning, tissue dehydration with graded methanol solutions and careful critical point drying. Coupled with the helium ion system, fine details such as membrane texture and membranous nanoprojections on the glomerular podocytes were visualized, and pores within the filtration slit diaphragm could be seen in much greater detail than in previous scanning EM studies. In the collecting duct, the extensive and striking apical microplicae of the intercalated cells were imaged without the shrunken or distorted appearance that is typical with conventional sample processing and scanning electron microscopy. Membrane depressions visible on principal cells suggest possible endo- or exocytotic events, and central cilia on these cells were imaged with remarkable preservation and clarity. We also demonstrate the use of colloidal gold probes for highlighting specific cell-surface proteins and find that 15 nm gold labels are practical and easily distinguishable, indicating that external labels of various sizes can be used to detect multiple targets in the same tissue. We conclude that this technology represents a technical breakthrough in imaging the topographical ultrastructure of animal tissues. Its use in future studies should allow the study of fine cellular details and provide significant advances in our understanding of cell surface structures and membrane organization.},

The mechanism of cdc2/cyclin B activation is complex, but the final step is the dephosphorylation of the Thr14 and Tyr15 residues on the cdc2 subunit, catalyzed by a member of the Cdc25 family of phosphatases. Cdc2/cyclin B1 accumulates at the centrosome in late G2 phase and has been implicated in the conversion of the centrosome from an interphase to a mitotic microtubule organizing center. Here we demonstrate biochemically that cdc2/cyclin B1 accumulates at the centrosome in late G2 as the inactive, phosphotyrosine 15 form and that the centrosomal cdc2/cyclin B1 can be activated in vitro by recombinant cdc25B. We provide evidence that a portion of the cdc2/cyclin B1 translocated into the nucleus in prophase is the inactive tyrosine-15-phosphorylated form. At this time the centrosomal and cytoplasmic cdc2/cyclin B1 is already active. This provides evidence that the activation of cdc2/cyclin B1 is initiated in the cytoplasm and that full activation of the translocated pool occurs in the nucleus.},

An aberrant Twist expression has been found in diverse types of cancer, including sarcomas, carcinomas and lymphomas, supporting a role for Twist in tumor progression. Twist is known to be essential for mesodermal development. However, since a prolonged Twist expression results in a block of muscle, cartilage and bone differentiation, Twist has to be excluded from somites during late embryogenesis for terminal differentiation to occur. This implies that Twist expression must be target of a tight control. Here we provide evidence that Twist undergoes post-transcriptional regulation. Twist is substrate for cleavage by caspases during apoptosis and its cleavage results in ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. Our findings suggest that Twist post-transcriptional regulation may play an important role in tissue determination and raise the possibility that alterations in the protein turnover may account for Twist overexpression observed in tumors.},

  abstract = {The balance between cell cycle progression and apoptosis is important for both surveillance against genomic defects and responses to drugs that arrest the cell cycle. In this report, we show that the level of the human anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 is regulated during the cell cycle and peaks at mitosis. Mcl-1 is phosphorylated at two sites in mitosis, Ser64 and Thr92. Phosphorylation of Thr92 by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)-cyclin B1 initiates degradation of Mcl-1 in cells arrested in mitosis by microtubule poisons. Mcl-1 destruction during mitotic arrest requires proteasome activity and is dependent on Cdc20/Fizzy, which mediates recognition of mitotic substrates by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase. Stabilisation of Mcl-1 during mitotic arrest by mutation of either Thr92 or a D-box destruction motif inhibits the induction of apoptosis by microtubule poisons. Thus, phosphorylation of Mcl-1 by CDK1-cyclin B1 and its APC/C(Cdc20)-mediated destruction initiates apoptosis if a cell fails to resolve mitosis. Regulation of apoptosis, therefore, is linked intrinsically to progression through mitosis and is governed by a temporal mechanism that distinguishes between normal mitosis and prolonged mitotic arrest.},

Compared with those of other transcription factors, this activity implies that pioneer factors can recognize their target DNA sequences in so-called compacted or ``closed'' heterochromatin and can trigger remodeling of the adjoining chromatin landscape to provide accessibility to nonpioneer transcription factors. Recent studies identified several steps of pioneer action, namely rapid but weak initial binding to heterochromatin and stabilization of binding followed by chromatin opening and loss of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) methylation that provides epigenetic memory. Whereas CpG demethylation depends on replication, chromatin opening does not. In this Minireview, we highlight the unique properties of this transcription factor class and the challenges of understanding their mechanism of action.},

At least three types of cell-cell adhesion have been observed: symmetric homotypic, asymmetric homotypic and heterotypic cell adhesions. Cadherins and nectins, which are known cell-cell adhesion molecules, mediate these cell adhesions. Cadherins comprise a family of more than 100 members, but they are primarily involved in homophilic trans-interactions (i.e. interactions between the same cadherin members) between opposing cells. By contrast, the nectin family comprises only four members, and these proteins form both homophilic and heterophilic trans-interactions (i.e. interactions between the same and different nectin members on opposing cells). In addition, heterophilic trans-interactions between nectins are much stronger than homophilic trans-interactions. Because of these unique properties, nectins have crucial roles in asymmetric homotypic cell-cell adhesion at neuronal synapses and in various types of heterotypic cell-cell adhesions. We summarize recent progress in our understanding of the biology of nectins and discuss their roles in heterotypic cell-cell adhesions, whose formation cannot be solely explained by the action of cadherins.},

  abstract = {Myc proteins regulate cell growth and division and are implicated in a wide range of human cancers. We show here that Fbw7, a component of the SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase and a tumor suppressor, promotes proteasome-dependent c-Myc turnover in vivo and c-Myc ubiquitination in vitro. Phosphorylation of c-Myc on threonine-58 (T58) by glycogen synthase kinase 3 regulates the binding of Fbw7 to c-Myc as well as Fbw7-mediated c-Myc degradation and ubiquitination. T58 is the most frequent site of c-myc mutations in lymphoma cells, and our findings suggest that c-Myc activation is one of the key oncogenic consequences of Fbw7 loss in cancer. Because Fbw7 mediates the degradation of cyclin E, Notch, and c-Jun, as well as c-Myc, the loss of Fbw7 is likely to elicit profound effects on cell proliferation during tumorigenesis.},

  abstract = {The large multimeric glycoprotein Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is best known for its role in haemostasis; however in recent years other functions of VWF have been identified, indicating that this protein is involved in multiple vascular processes. We recently described a new role for VWF in controlling angiogenesis, which may have significant clinical implications for patients with Von Willebrand disease (VWD), a genetic or acquired condition caused by the deficiency or dysfunction of VWF. VWD can be associated with angiodysplasia, a condition of degenerative blood vessels often present in the gastrointestinal tract, linked to dysregulated angiogenesis. Angiodysplasia can cause severe intractable bleeding, often refractory to conventional VWD treatments. In this review we summarise the evidence showing that VWF controls angiogenesis, and review the angiogenic pathways which have been implicated in this process. We discuss the possible mechanisms though which VWF regulates angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and integrin {$\alpha$}v{$\beta$}3, leading to signalling through vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), one of the most potent activators of angiogenesis. We also review the evidence that links VWF with angiodysplasia, and how the newly identified function of VWF in controlling angiogenesis may pave the way for the development of novel therapies for the treatment of angiodysplasia in congenital VWD and in acquired conditions such as Heyde syndrome.},

Using an integrated approach involving experiments in microfluidic chips and computational modelling, we studied gene expression and phenotypic changes associated with the mating response under well-defined pheromone gradients. Here we report a combination of switch-like and graded pathway responses leading to stochastic phenotype determination in a specific range of pheromone concentrations. Furthermore, we show that these responses are critically dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated regulation of the activity of the pheromone-response-specific transcription factor, Ste12, as well as on the autoregulatory feedback of Ste12. In particular, both the switch-like characteristics and sensitivity of gene expression in shmooing cells to pheromone concentration were significantly diminished in cells lacking Kss1, one of the MAP kinases activated in the mating pathway. In addition, the dynamic range of gradient sensing of Kss1-deficient cells was reduced compared with wild type. We thus provide unsuspected functional significance for this kinase in regulation of the mating response.},

However, the mechanisms by which PKCs activate mTORC1 are still ambiguous. Our previous study revealed that activation of classical PKCs (cPKC) results in the perinuclear accumulation of cPKC and phospholipase D2 (PLD2) in recycling endosomes in a PLD2-dependent manner. Here, we report that mTORC1 activation by phorbol 12,13-myristate acetate (PMA) requires both classic, cPKC, and novel PKC (nPKC) isoforms, specifically PKC{$\eta$}, acting through distinct pathways. The translocation of mTOR to perinuclear lysosomes was detected after treatment of PKC activators, which was not colocalized with PKC{$\alpha$}- or RAB11-positive endosomes and was not inhibited by PLD inhibitors. We found that PKC{$\eta$} inhibition by siRNA or bisindolylmaleimide I effectively decreased mTOR accumulation in lysosomes and its activity. Also, we identified that PKC{$\eta$} plays a role upstream of the v-ATPase/Ragulator/Rag pathway in response to PMA. These data provides a spatial aspect to the regulation of mTORC1 by sustained activation of PKC, requiring co-ordinated activation of two distinct elements, the perinuclear accumulation of cPKC- and PLD-containing endosomes and the nPKC-dependent translation of of mTOR in the perinuclear lysosomes. The close proximity of these two distinct compartments shown in this study suggests the possibility that transcompartment signaling may be a factor in the regulation of mTORC1 activity and also underscores the importance of PKC{$\eta$} as a potential therapeutic target of mTORC-related disorders.},

A., Boxer, L. M., and Reusch, J. E.-B. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 27529-27535). In the present investigation, we define a second pathway contributing to CREB-dependent up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression as a novel anti-apoptotic function of Akt signaling. To examine the role of Akt on Bcl-2 expression, a series of transient transfections using a luciferase reporter gene driven by the promoter region of Bcl-2 containing a CRE were carried out. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, the upstream kinase of Akt, with LY294002 led to a 45\% decrease in Bcl-2 promoter activity. The reporter activity was enhanced 2.3-fold by overexpression of active p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase and inhibited 44\% by the dominant negative p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. Cotransfection with 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1), which is required for the full activation of Akt, resulted in enhanced luciferase activity. Insulin-like growth factor-I-mediated induction of Bcl-2 promoter activity was decreased significantly (p {$<$} 0.01) by the dominant negative forms of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, PDK1, and Akt. These data indicate that regulation of Bcl-2 expression by IGF-I involves a signaling cascade mediated by PI 3-kinase/PDK1/Akt/CREB. Furthermore, we measured the Bcl-2 mRNA in PC12 cells overexpressing Akt by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the TaqMan(TM) fluorogenic probe system. We observed a 2.1-fold increase in Bcl-2 mRNA levels in the Akt cell line compared with control PC12 cells, supporting the observation that enhanced CREB activity by Akt signaling leads to increased Bcl-2 promoter activity and cell survival.},

  abstract = {Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in the mouse is a commonly used experimental model for pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. TAC initially leads to compensated hypertrophy of the heart, which often is associated with a temporary enhancement of cardiac contractility. Over time, however, the response to the chronic hemodynamic overload becomes maladaptive, resulting in cardiac dilatation and heart failure. The murine TAC model was first validated by Rockman et al., and has since been extensively used as a valuable tool to mimic human cardiovascular diseases and elucidate fundamental signaling processes involved in the cardiac hypertrophic response and heart failure development. When compared to other experimental models of heart failure, such as complete occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, TAC provides a more reproducible model of cardiac hypertrophy and a more gradual time course in the development of heart failure. Here, we describe a step-by-step procedure to perform surgical TAC in mice. To determine the level of pressure overload produced by the aortic ligation, a high frequency Doppler probe is used to measure the ratio between blood flow velocities in the right and left carotid arteries. With surgical survival rates of 80-90\%, transverse aortic banding is an effective technique of inducing left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure in mice.},

  abstract = {To understand the dynamics of the cell cycle, we need to characterize the balance between cell cycle arrest and cell proliferation, which is often deregulated in cancers. We address this issue by means of a detailed computational model for the network of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) driving the mammalian cell cycle. Previous analysis of the model focused on how this balance is controlled by growth factors (GFs) or the levels of activators (oncogenes) and inhibitors (tumour suppressors) of cell cycle progression. Supra-threshold changes in the level of any of these factors can trigger a switch in the dynamical behaviour of the Cdk network corresponding to a bifurcation between a stable steady state, associated with cell cycle arrest, and sustained oscillations of the various cyclin/Cdk complexes, corresponding to cell proliferation. Here, we focus on the regulation of cell proliferation by cellular environmental factors external to the Cdk network, such as the extracellular matrix (ECM), and contact inhibition, which increases with cell density. We extend the model for the Cdk network by including the phenomenological effect of both the ECM, which controls the activation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that promotes cell cycle progression, and cell density, which inhibits cell proliferation via the Hippo/YAP pathway. The model shows that GFs and FAK activation are capable of triggering in a similar dynamical manner the transition to cell proliferation, while the Hippo/YAP pathway can arrest proliferation once cell density passes a critical threshold. The results account for the dependence or independence of cell proliferation on serum and/or cell anchorage to ECM. Whether the balance in the Cdk network is tilted towards cell cycle arrest or proliferation depends on the direction in which the threshold associated with the bifurcation is passed once the cell integrates the multiple, internal or external signals that promote or impede progression in the cell cycle.},

In recent years, evidence has accumulated confirming the importance of such intercellular communication and exploring the molecular mechanisms involved. These mechanisms are based both on direct physical interactions, which coordinate the cellular responses, and on the collective cell behaviour that generates an optimal environment for efficient directed migration.

Mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor gene is responsible for both the familial and sporadic forms of this disease.

Here, we show that TSC1-TSC2 inhibits the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (an activator of translation) and activates the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1, an inhibitor of translational initiation). These functions of TSC1-TSC2 are mediated by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Furthermore, TSC2 is directly phosphorylated by Akt, which is involved in stimulating cell growth and is activated by growth stimulating signals, such as insulin. TSC2 is inactivated by Akt-dependent phosphorylation, which destabilizes TSC2 and disrupts its interaction with TSC1.

Here we show that in clonal populations of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, spontaneous 'outlier' cells with either extremely high or low expression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a; ref. 9) reconstitute the parental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week. This slow relaxation is described by a gaussian mixture model that incorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete subpopulations, suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despite clonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although their unique gene expression profiles eventually reverted to that of the median cells, revealing an attractor state, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly different proclivity for choosing either the erythroid or the myeloid lineage. Preference in lineage choice was associated with increased expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, such as a {$>$}200-fold increase in Gata1 (ref. 10) among the erythroid-prone cells, or a {$>$}15-fold increased PU.1 (Sfpi1) (ref. 11) expression among myeloid-prone cells. Thus, clonal heterogeneity of gene expression level is not due to independent noise in the expression of individual genes, but reflects metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome that is distinct in individual cells and may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision.},

In mammalian cells, several genes known to be induced during the immediate early response to growth factors, including the protooncogenes c-fos and c-myc, have also been shown to be induced by ROS. We show that members of the STAT family of transcription factors, including STAT1 and STAT3, are activated in fibroblasts and A-431 carcinoma cells in response to H2O2. This activation occurs within 5 min, can be inhibited by antioxidants, and does not require protein synthesis. STAT activation in these cell lines is oxidant specific and does not occur in response to superoxide- or nitric oxide-generating stimuli. Buthionine sulfoximine, which depletes intracellular glutathione, also activates the STAT pathway. Moreover, H2O2 stimulates the activity of the known STAT kinases JAK2 and TYK2. Activation of STATs by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is significantly inhibited by N-acetyl-L-cysteine and diphenylene iodonium, indicating that ROS production contributes to STAT activation in response to PDGF. These findings indicate that the JAK-STAT pathway responds to intracellular ROS and that PDGF uses ROS as a second messenger to regulate STAT activation.},

In this review we will focus on aurora-A that starts to localize to centrosomes only in S phase as soon as centrioles have been duplicated, the protein is then degraded in early G1. Works in various organisms have revealed that the kinase is involved in centrosome separation, duplication and maturation as well as in bipolar spindle assembly and stability. Aurora kinases are found in all organisms in which their function has been conserved throughout evolution, namely the control of chromosome segregation. In human, aurora-A has focused a lot of attention, since its overexpression has been found to be correlated with the grade of various solid tumours. Ectopic kinase overexpression in any culture cell line leads to polyploidy and centrosome amplification. However, overexpression of aurora-A in particular cell lines such as NIH3T3 is sufficient to induce growth on soft agar. Those transformed cells form tumours when implanted in immunodeficient mice, indicating that the kinase is an oncogene.},

We report here that caspase-2 (ICH-1/NEDD-2), a member of the ICE family, is activated during apoptosis by another ICE member, a caspase-3 (CPP32)-like protease(s). When cells are induced to undergo apoptosis, endogenous caspase-2 is first cleaved into three fragments of 32-33 kDa and 14 kDa, which are then further processed into 18- and 12-kDa active subunits. Up to 50 microM N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD-CHO), a caspase-3-preferred peptide inhibitor, inhibits caspase-2 activation and DNA fragmentation in vivo, but does not prevent loss of mitochondrial function, while higher concentrations of DEVD-CHO ({$>$}50 microM) inhibit both. In comparison, although the activity of caspase-3 is very sensitive to the inhibition of DEVD-CHO ({$<$}50 nM), inhibition of caspase-3 activation as marked by processing of the proform requires more than 100 microM DEVD-CHO. Our results suggest that the first cleavage of caspase-2 is accomplished by a caspase-3-like activity, and other ICE-like proteases less sensitive to DEVD-CHO may be responsible for activation of caspase-3 and loss of mitochondrial function.},

Electrophoretic mobility shift, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified Slug as a direct transcriptional activator at E-boxes of the ZEB1 promoter. Transcriptional activation of ZEB1 was demonstrated to be specific for Slug, since EMT regulators Snail and Twist failed to influence ZEB1 expression. Slug and ZEB1 cooperatively repressed E-cadherin expression resulting in decreased adhesion to human keratinocytes, but promoted migration of melanoma cells. Our results show that the transcriptional activity of ZEB1 is increased by Slug, suggesting a hierarchical organized expression of EMT transcription factors through directed activation, triggering an EMT-like process in melanoma.},

Yap1 mediates this effect through interaction with TEAD transcription factors. Additionally, our studies reveal that {$\alpha$}-catenin, a molecule previously implicated in tumor suppression and cell density sensing in the skin, is an upstream negative regulator of Yap1. {$\alpha$}-catenin controls Yap1 activity and phosphorylation by modulating its interaction with 14-3-3 and the PP2A phosphatase. Together, these data identify Yap1 as a determinant of the proliferative capacity of epidermal stem cells and as an important effector of a "crowd control" molecular circuitry in mammalian skin.},

We now show, for the first time, that the interaction of p53 with DNA can be stabilized by small molecules, such as ADP and dADP. Our results also indicate an ATP/ADP molecular switch mechanism which determines the off-on states for p53-DNA binding. This ATP/ADP molecular switch requires dimer-dimer interaction of the p53 tetramer. Dissociation of p53-DNA complexes by ATP is independent of ATP hydrolysis. Low-level ATPase activity is nonetheless associated with ATP-p53 interaction and may serve to regenerate ADP-p53, thus recycling the high-affinity DNA binding form of p53. The ATP/ADP regulatory mechanism applies to two distinct types of p53 interaction with DNA, namely, sequence-specific DNA binding (via the core domain of the p53 protein) and binding to sites of DNA damage (via the C-terminal domain). Further studies indicate that ADP not only stabilizes p53-DNA complexes but also renders the complexes susceptible to dissociation by specific p53 binding proteins. We propose a model in which the DNA binding functions of p53 are regulated by an ATP/ADP molecular switch, and we suggest that this mechanism may function during the cellular response to DNA damage.},

Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are related mechanosensory proteins that bind to Smad transcription factors, the canonical mediators of profibrotic TGF-{$\beta$} responses. Here, we investigated the role of YAP/TAZ in the matrix stiffness dependence of fibroblast responses to TGF-{$\beta$} In contrast to growth on a stiff surface, fibroblast growth on a soft matrix led to YAP/TAZ sequestration in the cytosol and impaired TGF-{$\beta$}-induced Smad2/3 nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity. YAP knockdown or treatment with verteporfin, a drug that was recently identified as a potent YAP inhibitor, elicited similar changes. Furthermore, verteporfin reduced YAP/TAZ levels and decreased the total cellular levels of Smad2/3 after TGF-{$\beta$} stimulation. Verteporfin treatment of mice subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction similarly reduced YAP/TAZ levels and nuclear Smad accumulation in the kidney, and attenuated renal fibrosis. Our data suggest that organ stiffening cooperates with TGF-{$\beta$} to induce fibrosis in a YAP/TAZ- and Smad2/3-dependent manner. Interference with this YAP/TAZ and TGF-{$\beta$}/Smad crosstalk likely underlies the antifibrotic activity of verteporfin. Finally, through repurposing of a clinically used drug, we illustrate the therapeutic potential of a novel mechanointerference strategy that blocks TGF-{$\beta$} signaling and renal fibrogenesis.},

To delineate the mechanism(s) utilized by RB to exert its anti-proliferative activity, constitutively active RB proteins (which cannot be inactivated by phosphorylation) or p16ink4a (which prevents RB inactivation) were utilized. Both proteins inhibited the G(1)-S transition, whereas wild-type RB did not. We show that active RB acts to attenuate cyclin A promoter activity, and that overexpression of cyclin E reverses RB-mediated repression of the cyclin A promoter. Although cyclin A is an E2F-regulated gene, and it has been long hypothesized that RB mediates cell cycle advancement through binding to E2F and attenuating its transactivation potential, cyclin E does not reverse dominant negative E2F-mediated repression of the cyclin A promoter. Although active RB repressed both cyclin A and two other paradigm E2F-regulated promoters, only cyclin A transcription was restored upon co-expression of cyclin E. Additionally, we show that RB but not dominant negative E2F regulates the cyclin A promoter through the CCRE element. These data identify cyclin A as a downstream target of RB-mediated arrest. Consistent with this idea, ectopic expression of cyclin A reversed RB-mediated G(1) arrest. The findings presented suggest a pathway wherein cyclin A is a downstream target of RB, and cyclin E functions to antagonize this aspect of RB-mediated G(1)-S inhibition.},

We analyzed the probabilistic and transient differentiation of Bacillus subtilis cells into the state of competence. A few key parameters independently tuned the frequency of initiation and the duration of competence episodes and allowed the circuit to access different dynamic regimes, including oscillation. Altering circuit architecture showed that the duration of competence events can be made more precise. We used an experimental method to reduce global cellular noise and showed that noise levels are correlated with frequency of differentiation events. Together, the data reveal a noise-dependent circuit that is remarkably resilient and tunable in terms of its dynamic behavior. A genetic circuit for bacterial cell differentiation exhibits a surprisingly varied repertoire of dynamic responses that depend on the amount of noise in the component biochemical reactions.

Polarized cell migration, another key event, is a tightly regulated process that occurs during tissue development, chemotaxis and wound healing. Rho-family small GTPases, especially Rac1 and Cdc42, play pivotal roles in these processes through one of their effectors, IQGAP1. Recent studies reveal that IQGAP1 regulates cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion both positively and negatively. It captures and stabilizes microtubules through the microtubule-binding protein CLIP-170 near the cell cortex, leading to establishment of polarized cell morphology and directional cell migration. Furthermore, Rac1 and Cdc42 link the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein to actin filaments through IQGAP1 at the leading edge and thereby regulate polarization and directional migration.},

  abstract = {LATS (large tumor suppressor) or warts is a Ser/Thr kinase that belongs to the Ndr/LATS subfamily of AGC (protein kinase A/PKG/PKC) kinases. It is a tumor suppressor gene originally isolated from Drosophila and recently isolated from mice and humans. Drosophila or mice mutant for LATS develop tumors in various tissues. Recent studies in Drosophila demonstrate that LATS is a central player of an emerging tumor suppressor pathway called the Hippo-LATS/Warts pathway that suppresses tumor growth by regulating cell proliferation, cell growth, and cell death. Although tremendous progress has been made toward understanding the roles of LATS in tumorigenesis, the kinase substrates of LATS or downstream target proteins mediating LATS function remain largely unknown. In this study, we have provided convincing evidence that the LATS1 tumor suppressor can bind to and phosphorylate transcription regulator and oncogene YAP in vitro and in vivo. We have also identified HX(R/H/K)XX(S/T) as the consensus phosphorylation sequence for LATS/Ndr kinase substrates. Significantly, we have discovered that LATS1 inactivates YAP oncogenic function by suppressing its transcription regulation of cellular genes via sequestration of YAP in the cytoplasm after phosphorylation of YAP. Finally, by using microarray analysis, we have also identified many oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes up-regulated or down-regulated by YAP. These research findings will have profound impacts on our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the LATS tumor suppressor and the emerging Hippo-LATS/Warts pathway.},

Fourteen mammalian caspases have been identified, three of which (caspase-3, -6, and -7) are thought to coordinate the execution phase of apoptosis by cleaving multiple structural and repair proteins. However, the relative contributions that the "executioner" caspases make to the demolition of the cell remains speculative. Here we have used cell-free extracts immuno-depleted of either caspase-3, -6, or -7 to examine the caspase requirements for apoptosis-associated proteolysis of 14 caspase substrates as well as nuclear condensation, chromatin margination, and DNA fragmentation. We show that caspase-3 is the primary executioner caspase in this system, necessary for cytochrome c/dATP-inducible cleavage of fodrin, gelsolin, U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, DNA fragmentation factor 45 (DFF45)/inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD), receptor-interacting protein (RIP), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (X-IAP), signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1), topoisomerase I, vimentin, Rb, and lamin B but not for cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) or lamin A. In addition, caspase-3 was also essential for apoptosis-associated chromatin margination, DNA fragmentation, and nuclear collapse in this system. Surprisingly, although caspase-6 and -7 are considered to be important downstream effector caspases, depletion of either caspase had minimal impact on any of the parameters investigated, calling into question their precise role during the execution phase of apoptosis.},

FAK is overexpressed in human tumours, and FAK regulates both cellular adhesion and anti-apoptotic survival signalling. Disruption of FAK function by overexpression of the FAK C-terminal domain [FAK-CD, analogous to the FRNK (FAK-related non-kinase) protein] leads to loss of adhesion and apoptosis in tumour cells. We have shown that overexpression of an activated form of the Src tyrosine kinase suppressed the loss of adhesion induced by dominant-negative; adenoviral FAK-CD and decreased the apoptotic response in BT474 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. This adhesion-dependent apoptosis was increased by the Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2 [4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine]. We have also shown that expression of activated Src in breast cancer cells increased the expression of alpha2-integrin and that overexpression of alpha2-integrin suppressed FAK-CD-mediated loss of adhesion. Our results suggest a model in which Src regulates adhesion and survival through enhanced expression of the alpha2-integrin. This provides a mechanism through which Src promotes cellular adhesion and alters the adhesive function of FAK.},

Akt phosphorylates numerous protein targets that control cell survival, proliferation and motility. Previous studies suggest that Akt regulates transcriptional activity of the nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B (NF{$\kappa$}B) by inducing phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of inhibitor of {$\kappa$}B (I{$\kappa$}B). We show here that NF{$\kappa$}B-driven transcription increases in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) transformed by myristylated Akt (myrAkt). Accordingly, both a dominant negative mutant of Akt and Akt inhibitors repress NF{$\kappa$}B-dependent transcription. The degradation of the I{$\kappa$}B protein is strongly enhanced in Akt-transformed cells, and the loss of NF{$\kappa$}B activity by introduction of a super-repressor of NF{$\kappa$}B, I{$\kappa$}BSR, interferes with PI3K- and Akt-induced oncogenic transformation of CEF. The phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF{$\kappa$}B at serine 534 is also upregulated in Akt-transformed cells. Our data suggest that the stimulation of NF{$\kappa$}B by Akt is dependent on the phosphorylation of p65 at S534, mediated by IKK (I{$\kappa$}B kinase) {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$}. Akt phosphorylates IKK{$\alpha$} on T23, and this phosphorylation event is a prerequisite for the phosphorylation of p65 at S534 by IKK{$\alpha$} and {$\beta$}. Our results demonstrate two separate functions of the IKK complex in NF{$\kappa$}B activation in cells with constitutive Akt activity: the phosphorylation and consequent degradation of I{$\kappa$}B and the phosphorylation of p65. The data further support the conclusion that NF{$\kappa$}B activity is essential for PI3K- and Akt-induced oncogenic transformation.},

Since its discovery in Drosophila {$\sim$}25 years ago, Snail has been extensively studied for its role as a transcriptional repressor. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila Snail can positively modulate transcriptional activation. By combining information on in vivo occupancy with expression profiling of hand-selected, staged snail mutant embryos, we identified 106 genes that are potentially directly regulated by Snail during mesoderm development. In addition to the expected Snail-repressed genes, almost 50\% of Snail targets showed an unanticipated activation. The majority of "Snail-activated" genes have enhancer elements cobound by Twist and are expressed in the mesoderm at the stages of Snail occupancy. Snail can potentiate Twist-mediated enhancer activation in vitro and is essential for enhancer activity in vivo. Using a machine learning approach, we show that differentially enriched motifs are sufficient to predict Snail's regulatory response. In silico mutagenesis revealed a likely causative motif, which we demonstrate is essential for enhancer activation. Taken together, these data indicate that Snail can potentiate enhancer activation by collaborating with different activators, providing a new mechanism by which Snail regulates development.},

UCN-01 is such a compound that overrides the G2 cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage and forces cells into a deleterious mitosis. The molecular pathways leading to mitotic cell death are largely unknown although recent evidence indicates that mitotic cell death represents a special case of apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that the mitotic spindle checkpoint is activated upon chemotherapeutic treatment with topoisomerase II poisons and UCN-01. Cells that are forced to enter mitosis in the presence of topoisomerase inhibition arrest transiently in a prometaphase like state. By using a novel pharmacological inhibitor of the spindle checkpoint and spindle checkpoint-deficient cells we show that the spindle checkpoint function is required for the mitotic arrest and, most importantly, for efficient induction of mitotic cell death. Thus, our results demonstrate that the mitotic spindle checkpoint is an important determinant for the outcome of a chemotherapy based on the induction of mitotic cell death. Its frequent inactivation in human cancer might contribute to the observed resistance of tumor cells to these chemotherapeutic drugs.},

The activation of cell growth and mTORC1 by E2F1 is dependent on both E2F1's ability to bind DNA and to regulate gene transcription, demonstrating that a gene induction expression program is required in this process. Unlike E2F1, E2F3 is unable to activate mTORC1, suggesting that growth activity could be restricted to individual E2F members. The effect of E2F1 on the activation of mTORC1 does not depend on Akt. Furthermore, over-expression of TSC2 does not interfere with the effect of E2F1, indicating that the E2F1-induced signal pathway can compensate for the inhibitory effect of TSC2 on Rheb. Immunolocalization studies demonstrate that E2F1 induces the translocation of mTORC1 to the late endosome vesicles, in a mechanism dependent of leucine. E2F1 and leucine, or insulin, together affect the activation of S6K stronger than alone suggesting that they are complementary in activating the signal pathway. From these studies, E2F1 emerges as a key protein that integrates cell division and growth, both of which are essential for cell proliferation.},

  abstract = {The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays a role in most cellular functions linked to cancer progression, including cell growth, proliferation, cell survival, tissue invasion and angiogenesis. It is generally recognized that hyperactive PI3K/AKT1 are oncogenic due to their boost to cell survival, cell cycle entry and growth-promoting metabolism. That said, the dynamics of PI3K and AKT1 during cell cycle progression are highly nonlinear. In addition to negative feedback that curtails their activity, protein expression of PI3K subunits has been shown to oscillate in dividing cells. The low-PI3K/low-AKT1 phase of these oscillations is required for cytokinesis, indicating that oncogenic PI3K may directly contribute to genome duplication. To explore this, we construct a Boolean model of growth factor signaling that can reproduce PI3K oscillations and link them to cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The resulting modular model reproduces hyperactive PI3K-driven cytokinesis failure and genome duplication and predicts the molecular drivers responsible for these failures by linking hyperactive PI3K to mis-regulation of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) expression late in G2. To do this, our model captures the role of Plk1 in cell cycle progression and accurately reproduces multiple effects of its loss: G2 arrest, mitotic catastrophe, chromosome mis-segregation / aneuploidy due to premature anaphase, and cytokinesis failure leading to genome duplication, depending on the timing of Plk1 inhibition along the cell cycle. Finally, we offer testable predictions on the molecular drivers of PI3K oscillations, the timing of these oscillations with respect to division, and the role of altered Plk1 and FoxO activity in genome-level defects caused by hyperactive PI3K. Our model is an important starting point for the predictive modeling of cell fate decisions that include AKT1-driven senescence, as well as the non-intuitive effects of drugs that interfere with mitosis.},

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a focal adhesion adaptor and a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell proliferation, survival and EMT. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms necessary for development and progression of human malignancies is critical to predict the most appropriate targets for cancer therapy. Here, we used transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF{$\beta$}-1) to promote EMT and migration in mammary epithelial cells. We demonstrate a requirement of ILK activity for TGF{$\beta$}-1-mediated EMT in mammary epithelial cells. In addition to nuclear translocation of Snail and Slug, TGF{$\beta$}-1 treatment also induced expression of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 component Rictor and its phosphorylation on Thr1135. Interestingly, TGF{$\beta$}-1 treatment also induced an interaction between ILK and Rictor. All of these TGF{$\beta$}-1-induced processes were significantly suppressed by inhibiting ILK activity or by disrupting the ILK/Rictor complex using small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown. Furthermore, we identified ILK/Rictor complex formation in cancer but not in normal cell types, and this was accompanied by ILK-dependent phosphorylation of Rictor on residue Thr1135. Inhibition of ILK partially reversed the basal mesenchymal phenotype of MDA-MB-231 cells and prevented EMT in MCF10A cells after TGF{$\beta$}-1 treatment. These data demonstrate a requirement for ILK function in TGF{$\beta$}-1-induced EMT in mammary epithelial cells and identify the ILK/Rictor complex as a potential molecular target for preventing/reversing EMT.},

Here, we show that Smad4, a transcription factor normally required for TGFbeta-mediated inhibition of normal cell proliferation, enhances 4E-BP1 gene-promoter activity through binding to a conserved element. 4E-BP1 expression is specifically modulated by treatment with TGFbeta and by manipulations of the natural Smad4 regulators (co-Smads) in cells isolated from Smad4(+/+) human tumours, whereas no response is observed in cells isolated from Smad4(-/-) human tumours or in cells where Smad4 has been knocked down by specific siRNAs. In addition, cells where 4E-BP1 has been knocked down (inducible shRNAs in human pancreatic cancer cells or siRNAs in non-malignant human keratinocytes) or has been knocked out (mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from 4E-BP1(-/-) mice) proliferate faster and are resistant to the antiproliferative effect of TGFbeta.

Such stochastic cell fate decisions generate nongenetic cellular diversity, which may be critical for metazoan development as well as optimized microbial resource utilization and survival in a fluctuating, frequently stressful environment. Here, we review several examples of cellular decision making from viruses, bacteria, yeast, lower metazoans, and mammals, highlighting the role of regulatory network structure and molecular noise. We propose that cellular decision making is one of at least three key processes underlying development at various scales of biological organization.},

  abstract = {The Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling pathway is crucial for human organ development and is involved in tumor progression of many cancers. Accumulating evidence suggests that the expression of {$\beta$}-catenin is, in part, regulated by specific microRNAs (miRNAs). The purpose of this study was to determine the expression of a recently identified epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated tumor suppressor microRNA (miR)-200a, in cancer cells. We also aimed to identify specific miR-200a target genes and to investigate the antitumor effects of miR-200a on the Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling pathway. We employed TOP/FOP flash luciferase assays to identify the effect of miR-200a on the Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin pathway and we confirmed our observations using fluorescence microscopy. To determine target genes of miR-200a, a 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) luciferase assay was performed. Cell viability, invasion and wound healing assays were carried out for functional analysis after miRNA transfection. We further investigated the role of miR-200a in EMT by Western blot analysis. We found fluctuation in the expression of miR-200a that was accompanied by changes in the expression of members of the Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling pathway. We also determined that miR-200a can directly interact with the 3' UTR of CTNNB1 (the gene that encodes {$\beta$}-catenin) to suppress Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling. MiR-200a could also influence the biological activities of SGC790 and U251 cells. Our results demonstrate that miR-200a is a new tumor suppressor that can regulate the activity of the Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling pathway via two mechanisms. MiR-200a is a candidate target for tumor treatment via its regulation of the Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling pathway.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is no evidence to date on whether transcriptional regulators are able to shift the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission events through selective control of gene expression. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we demonstrate that reduced mitochondrial size observed in knock-out mice for the transcriptional regulator PGC-1beta is associated with a selective reduction in Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) expression, a mitochondrial fusion protein. This decrease in Mfn2 is specific since expression of the remaining components of mitochondrial fusion and fission machinery were not affected. Furthermore, PGC-1beta increases mitochondrial fusion and elongates mitochondrial tubules. This PGC-1beta-induced elongation specifically requires Mfn2 as this process is absent in Mfn2-ablated cells. Finally, we show that PGC-1beta increases Mfn2 promoter activity and transcription by coactivating the nuclear receptor Estrogen Related Receptor alpha (ERRalpha). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our data reveal a novel mechanism by which mammalian cells control mitochondrial fusion. In addition, we describe a novel role of PGC-1beta in mitochondrial physiology, namely the control of mitochondrial fusion mainly through Mfn2.},

For instance, the dataset can be obtained from the diagnosis of describing the diffusion process of cancer cells. With the observed datasets, several methods to construct the dynamic models for such Boolean networks are proposed. Instead of building the logical dynamics of a Boolean network directly, its algebraic form is constructed first and then is converted back to the logical form. Firstly, a general construction technique is proposed. To reduce the size of required data, the model with the known network graph is considered. Motivated by this, the least in-degree model is constructed that can reduce the size of required data set tremendously. Next, the uniform network is investigated. The number of required data points for identification of such networks is independent of the size of the network. Finally, some principles are proposed for dealing with data with errors.},

  abstract = {The capacity of DNA damaging agents to induce apoptosis is regulated by target gene induction by p53. We found that p53 targeted MDM2 in cells in which DNA repair was occurring, but persistent DNA damage induced by chemotherapy led p53 to selectively target PTEN. High dose chemotherapy induced the phosphorylation of p53 on serine 46, whereas low dose chemotherapy did not. A nonphosphorylatable serine 46 to alanine p53 mutant (S46A) targeted the MDM2 promoter in preference to that for PTEN. A serine 46 to aspartate mutant (S46D, a phosphorylation mimic) targeted PTEN in preference to MDM2. These observations show that phosphorylation of serine 46 in p53 is sufficient for it to induce the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) tumor suppressor protein in preference to MDM2. S46A induced significantly less cell death than the S46D in cells. The phosphorylation-induced change of p53 promoter targeting suppresses the induction of MDM2 and the formation of the autoregulatory feedback loop. Induction of PTEN by p53 followed by expression of PTEN inhibits AKT-induced translocation of MDM2 into the nucleus and sustains p53 function. The protection of p53 from MDM2 by PTEN and the damage-induced activation of PTEN by phosphorylated p53 leads to the formation of an apoptotic amplification cycle in which p53 and PTEN coordinately increase cellular apoptosis.},

  abstract = {Caspases are cysteine proteases that mediate apoptosis by proteolysis of specific substrates. Although many caspase substrates have been identified, for most substrates the physiologic caspase(s) required for cleavage is unknown. The Bcl-2 protein, which inhibits apoptosis, is cleaved at Asp-34 by caspases during apoptosis and by recombinant caspase-3 in vitro. In the present study, we show that endogenous caspase-3 is a physiologic caspase for Bcl-2. Apoptotic extracts from 293 cells cleave Bcl-2 but not Bax, even though Bax is cleaved to an 18-kDa fragment in SK-NSH cells treated with ionizing radiation. In contrast to Bcl-2, cleavage of Bax was only partially blocked by caspase inhibitors. Inhibitor profiles indicate that Bax may be cleaved by more than one type of noncaspase protease. Immunodepletion of caspase-3 from 293 extracts abolished cleavage of Bcl-2 and caspase-7, whereas immunodepletion of caspase-7 had no effect on Bcl-2 cleavage. Furthermore, MCF-7 cells, which lack caspase-3 expression, do not cleave Bcl-2 following staurosporine-induced cell death. However, transient transfection of caspase-3 into MCF-7 cells restores Bcl-2 cleavage after staurosporine treatment. These results demonstrate that in these models of apoptosis, specific cleavage of Bcl-2 requires activation of caspase-3. When the pro-apoptotic caspase cleavage fragment of Bcl-2 is transfected into baby hamster kidney cells, it localizes to mitochondria and causes the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Therefore, caspase-3-dependent cleavage of Bcl-2 appears to promote further caspase activation as part of a positive feedback loop for executing the cell.},

Most cases in adults are caused by acquired autoantibodies that inhibit ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease that cleaves von Willebrand factor within nascent platelet-rich thrombi to prevent hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and tissue infarction. Although approximately 80\% of patients respond to plasma exchange, which removes autoantibody and replenishes ADAMTS13, one third to one half of survivors develop refractory or relapsing disease. Intensive immunosuppressive therapy with rituximab appears to be effective as salvage therapy, and ongoing clinical trials should determine whether adjuvant rituximab with plasma exchange also is beneficial at first diagnosis. A major unanswered question is whether plasma exchange is effective for the subset of patients with idiopathic TTP who do not have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency.},

Hypoxia exposure of these transgenic mice resulted in increased VWF and LacZ mRNA levels as well as redistribution of their expression from primarily larger vessels in the lungs to microvessels. Exposure of cultured lung microvascular endothelial cells to hypoxia demonstrated that VWF upregulation was accompanied by increased platelet binding. Transcription upregulation was mediated through inhibition of the repressor nuclear factor-IB association with the VWF promoter, and increased nuclear translocation of the transcription factor YY1 and association with its cognate binding site on the VWF gene. Knockdown of YY1 expression abolished the hypoxia-induced upregulation and reduced basal level of VWF.Conclusions\textemdash These analyses demonstrate that hypoxia induces a phenotypic shift, accompanied by modulation of nuclear factor-IB and YY1 activities, in microvascular endothelial cells of the lungs to support VWF promoter activation.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of YAP on proliferation and apoptosis in OSCC and the molecular mechanism. The results showed the expression level of YAP was higher in OSCC tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues. Knockdown of YAP in CAL27 cell lines prohibited cell proliferation while augmented apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of YAP protected cells from apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation. Moreover, C-MYC and BCL-2 mRNA and protein levels were altered due to the differential expression of YAP. Subsequent Verteporfin treatment in CAL27 cells revealed that the transcription and translation of BCL-2 and C-MYC both decreased. In a tumor xenograft model, knockdown of YAP suppressed tumor growth of CAL27 in vivo, while YAP overexpression promoted the tumor growth. These results suggest that YAP is a crucial regulator that exerts pro-proliferation and anti-apoptosis effects in OSCC through actions affecting the cell cycle and intrinsic apoptotic signaling. Thus YAP could potentially serve as a valuable molecular biomarker or therapeutic target in the treatment of OSCC.},

Primary components of the DISC are trimerized TRAIL-R1/-R2, FADD, caspase 8 and caspase 10. The anti-apoptotic protein FLIP can also be recruited to the DISC to replace caspase 8 and form an inactive complex. Caspase 8/10 processing at the DISC triggers the caspase cascade, which eventually leads to apoptotic cell death. Besides TRAIL, TRAIL-R1- or TRAIL-R2-selective variants of TRAIL and agonistic antibodies have been designed. These ligands are of interest as anti-cancer agents since they selectively kill tumor cells. To increase tumor sensitivity to TRAIL death receptor-mediated apoptosis and to overcome drug resistance, TRAIL receptor ligands have already been combined with various therapies in preclinical models. In this review, we discuss factors influencing the initial steps of the TRAIL apoptosis signaling pathway, focusing on mechanisms modulating DISC assembly and caspase activation at the DISC. These insights will direct rational design of drug combinations with TRAIL receptor ligands to maximize DISC signaling.},

In this study, we demonstrate that Twist can transcriptionally repress E-cadherin in breast cancer cells. Using transient promoter assays, we show that Twist can down-regulate E-cadherin promoter activity by up to two folds. This is further supported by immunoblot analyses which indicates that over-expression of Twist decreases E-cadherin protein levels in breast cancer cell lines. Subsequently, chromatin immunoprecipitation performed on MCF-7/Twist and Hs578 T (high level of endogenous Twist expression) confirmed Twist binding to the E-cadherin promoter. Finally, the functional relevance of this regulation was verified by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry on a cohort of breast cancer samples.},

Moreover, somatic mutations of NF2 can occur in the sporadic counterparts of these neurological tumor types as well as in certain neoplasms of non-neuroectodermal origin, such as malignant mesothelioma and melanoma. NF2 encodes a 595-amino acid protein, merlin, which exhibits significant homology to the ezrin-radixin-moesin family of proteins. However, the mechanism by which merlin exerts its tumor suppressor activity is not well understood. In this investigation, we show that merlin is phosphorylated in response to expression of activated Rac and activated Cdc42 in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that merlin phosphorylation is mediated by p21-activated kinase (Pak), a common downstream target of both Rac and Cdc42. Both in vivo and in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that Pak can directly phosphorylate merlin at serine 518, a site that affects merlin activity and localization. These biochemical investigations provide insights into the regulation of merlin function and establish a framework for elucidating tumorigenic mechanisms involved in neoplasms associated with merlin inactivation.},

Chemical factors such as soluble growth factors and insoluble components of the extracellular matrix are known to affect the differentiation of murine ESCs. However, there is also evidence to suggest that undifferentiated cells can both sense the mechanical properties of their environment and differentiate accordingly. By growing ESCs on flexible polydimethylsiloxane substrates with varying stiffness, we tested the hypothesis that substrate stiffness can influence ESC differentiation. While cell attachment was unaffected by the stiffness of the growth substrate, cell spreading and cell growth were all increased as a function of substrate stiffness. Similarly, several genes expressed in the primitive streak during gastrulation and implicated in early mesendoderm differentiation, such as Brachyury, Mixl1 and Eomes, were upregulated in cell cultures on stiffer compared to softer substrates. Finally, we demonstrated that osteogenic differentiation of ESCs was enhanced on stiff substrates compared to soft substrates, illustrating that the mechanical environment can play a role in both early and terminal ESC differentiation. Our results suggest a fundamental role for mechanosensing in mammalian development and illustrate that the mechanical environment should be taken into consideration when engineering implantable scaffolds or when producing therapeutically relevant cell populations in vitro.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial-cadherin- and integrin-based cell adhesions are crucial for endothelial barrier function. Formation and disassembly of these adhesions controls endothelial remodeling during vascular repair, angiogenesis, and inflammation. In vitro studies indicate that vascular cytokines control adhesion through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, but it remains unknown whether such regulation occurs in human vessels. We aimed to investigate regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesions within the endothelium of human arteries and veins. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We used an ex vivo protocol for immunofluorescence in human vessels, allowing detailed en face microscopy of endothelial monolayers. We compared arteries and veins of the umbilical cord and mesenteric, epigastric, and breast tissues and find that the presence of central F-actin fibers distinguishes the endothelial phenotype of adult arteries from veins. F-actin in endothelium of adult veins as well as in umbilical vasculature predominantly localizes cortically at the cell boundaries. By contrast, prominent endothelial F-actin fibers in adult arteries anchor mostly to focal adhesions containing integrin-binding proteins paxillin and focal adhesion kinase and follow the orientation of the extracellular matrix protein Fibronectin. Other arterial F-actin fibers end in vascular endothelial-cadherin-based endothelial focal adherens junctions. In vitro adhesion experiments on compliant substrates demonstrate that formation of focal adhesions is strongly induced by extracellular matrix rigidity, irrespective of arterial or venous origin of endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that F-actin-anchored focal adhesions distinguish endothelial phenotypes of human arteries from veins. We conclude that the biomechanical properties of the vascular extracellular matrix determine this endothelial characteristic.},

H(2)O(2) is a mitogen for rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical event in VSMC mitogenesis. Therefore, we investigated whether the mitogenic effects of H(2)O(2), such as stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)2, are mediated via activation of cytoplasmic Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs). JAK2 was activated rapidly in VSMCs treated with H(2)O(2), and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) STAT1 and STAT3 were tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. Inhibition of JAK2 activity with AG-490 partially inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced ERK2 activity, suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase-ERK/ERK mitogenic pathway. Because heat-shock proteins (HSPs) can protect cells from ROS, we investigated the effect of H(2)O(2) on HSP expression. H(2)O(2) stimulated HSP70 expression in a time-dependent manner, and AG-490 abolished H(2)O(2)-induced HSP70 expression. H(2)O(2) activated the HSP70 promoter via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the promoter. Regulation of chaperones such as HSP70 via activation of the JAK/STAT pathway suggests that in addition to its growth-promoting effects, this pathway may help VSMCs adapt to oxidative stress.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), functional defects of neutrophils result in high mortality due to infections. However, the molecular basis of neutrophil dysfunction remains unclear. We recently found that miR-34a and miR-155 were significantly increased in MDS neutrophils.             To determine the effects of the aberrant expression of the microRNAs on neutrophil functions, HL60 cells, in which miR-34a, miR-155 or control microRNA was ectopically introduced by electroporation, were cultured in the presence of 500 {$\mu$}M dibutyryl cyclic AMP for 2 days to induce differentiation toward a neutrophil-like phenotype. After electroporation, the introduced microRNA levels became 100-fold or higher than those in control microRNA-treated cells. In differentiated cells, the cell surface expression of the differentiation marker CD11b and total amounts of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and elastase in primary granules were not altered by excess of miR-34a or miR-155. When stimulated with 200 nM N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), the control cells released 81.1 {$\pm$} 7.0\% of total MPO, which was significantly enhanced by overexpression of miR-34a (90.8 {$\pm$} 4.6\%; p{$<$}0.05) and miR-155 (90.5 {$\pm$} 5.5\%; p{$<$}0.05). Elastase release was also significantly increased by miR-34a (p{$<$}0.05) and miR-155 (p{$<$}0.05). In contrast, while 63.4 {$\pm$} 13.4\% of the control cells migrated toward 10 nM fMLP through 0.3 \textmu m pores over 90 min, the migration of the cells was significantly reduced with excess of miR-34a and miR-155 (42.7 {$\pm$} 14.6\%; p{$<$}0.05 and 40.3 {$\pm$} 9.2\%; p{$<$}0.05, respectively). Thus, overexpression of miR-34a and miR-155 enhanced degranulation but attenuated fMLP-induced migration.             To clarify the mechanisms of repression of migration, we examined the effects of miR-34a and miR-155 on Cdc42 and Rac1, Rho family members that are known to regulate migration but not degranulation. Although neither microRNA altered the protein levels of Cdc42, a pull-down assay of the GTP-bound active form of Cdc42 generated by stimulation with 10 {$\mu$}M fMLP for 1 min showed that both miR-34a and miR-155 reduced the ratio of GTP-bound/total Cdc42 to 29.0 {$\pm$} 15.9\% and 39.7 {$\pm$} 4.8\% of those in the control cells, respectively. These results suggested that both microRNAs interfered with the activation process of Cdc42. According to the databases, DOCK8 and FGD4, guanine nucleotide exchange factors that activate Cdc42, are direct targets of miR-34a and miR-155, respectively. In the cells with excess of miR-34a and miR-155, the level of DOCK8 protein detected was 68.8 {$\pm$} 11.1\% and 95.8 {$\pm$} 11.3\% of those in the control cells, respectively. Knockdown of DOCK8 by siRNA decreased the amount of the fMLP-induced active form of Cdc42 by 94.0 {$\pm$} 23.5\% (p{$<$}0.05) and the migration rate by 84.6 {$\pm$} 30.7\% (p{$<$}0.05) compared with those in the control cells. In contrast, the FGD4 protein level was decreased by miR-155 (56.8 {$\pm$} 28.6\% of control) but not by miR-34a (108.6 {$\pm$} 30.7\% of control). When the FGD4 protein level was decreased to 58.3 {$\pm$} 12.0\% by siRNA, migration toward fMLP was completely blocked. These data showed that miR-34a and miR-155 inhibited migration toward fMLP via reduction of different Cdc42 activators, DOCK8 and FGD4, respectively. Another Rho family member Rac1, which is known as a target of miR-155, was decreased in miR-155-introduced cells (56.2 {$\pm$} 27.9\% of control) but not in miR-34a-overexpressing cells (113.6 {$\pm$} 17.8\% of control). Reduction of Rac1 by siRNA (55.0 {$\pm$} 22.1\% of control) significantly attenuated the migration toward fMLP by 78.0 {$\pm$} 41.6\% (p{$<$}0.05). Thus, overexpression of miR-34a attenuated migration via reduction of the Cdc42 activator DOCK8, while miR-155 inhibited migration via reduction of Rac1 and the Cdc42 activator FGD4. This study suggests that an increase of miR-34a and miR-155 contributes to impairment of migration via different mechanisms in MDS neutrophils.

Notably, the EMT activators transforming growth factor beta2 and ZEB1 are the predominant targets downregulated by these microRNAs.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In the presence of drought and other desiccating stresses, plants synthesize and redistribute the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). ABA promotes plant water conservation by acting on specialized cells in the leaf epidermis, guard cells, which border and regulate the apertures of stomatal pores through which transpirational water loss occurs. Following ABA exposure, solute uptake into guard cells is rapidly inhibited and solute loss is promoted, resulting in inhibition of stomatal opening and promotion of stomatal closure, with consequent plant water conservation. There is a wealth of information on the guard cell signaling mechanisms underlying these rapid ABA responses. To investigate ABA regulation of gene expression in guard cells in a systematic genome-wide manner, we analyzed data from global transcriptomes of guard cells generated with Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays, and compared these results to ABA regulation of gene expression in leaves and other tissues. RESULTS: The 1173 ABA-regulated genes of guard cells identified by our study share significant overlap with ABA-regulated genes of other tissues, and are associated with well-defined ABA-related promoter motifs such as ABREs and DREs. However, we also computationally identified a unique cis-acting motif, GTCGG, associated with ABA-induction of gene expression specifically in guard cells. In addition, approximately 300 genes showing ABA-regulation unique to this cell type were newly uncovered by our study. Within the ABA-regulated gene set of guard cells, we found that many of the genes known to encode ion transporters associated with stomatal opening are down-regulated by ABA, providing one mechanism for long-term maintenance of stomatal closure during drought. We also found examples of both negative and positive feedback in the transcriptional regulation by ABA of known ABA-signaling genes, particularly with regard to the PYR/PYL/RCAR class of soluble ABA receptors and their downstream targets, the type 2C protein phosphatases. Our data also provide evidence for cross-talk at the transcriptional level between ABA and another hormonal inhibitor of stomatal opening, methyl jasmonate. CONCLUSIONS: Our results engender new insights into the basic cell biology of guard cells, reveal common and unique elements of ABA-regulation of gene expression in guard cells, and set the stage for targeted biotechnological manipulations to improve plant water use efficiency.},

  abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs during embryogenesis, carcinoma invasiveness, and metastasis and can be elicited by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling via intracellular Smad transducers. The molecular mechanisms that control the onset of EMT remain largely unexplored. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) gene is induced by the Smad pathway during EMT. Endogenous HMGA2 mediates EMT by TGF-beta, whereas ectopic HMGA2 causes irreversible EMT characterized by severe E-cadherin suppression. HMGA2 provides transcriptional input for the expression control of four known regulators of EMT, the zinc-finger proteins Snail and Slug, the basic helix-loop-helix protein Twist, and inhibitor of differentiation 2. We delineate a pathway that links TGF-beta signaling to the control of epithelial differentiation via HMGA2 and a cohort of major regulators of tumor invasiveness and metastasis. This network of signaling/transcription factors that work sequentially to establish EMT suggests that combinatorial detection of these proteins could serve as a new tool for EMT analysis in cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotency by Yamanaka factors is usually slow and inefficient and is thought to be a stochastic process. We identified a privileged somatic cell state, from which acquisition of pluripotency could occur in a nonstochastic manner. Subsets of murine hematopoietic progenitors are privileged whose progeny cells predominantly adopt the pluripotent fate with activation of endogenous Oct4 locus after four to five divisions in reprogramming conditions. Privileged cells display an ultrafast cell cycle of {$\sim$}8 hr. In fibroblasts, a subpopulation cycling at a similar ultrafast speed is observed after 6 days of factor expression and is increased by p53 knockdown. This ultrafast cycling population accounts for {$>$}99\% of the bulk reprogramming activity in wild-type or p53 knockdown fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that the stochastic nature of reprogramming can be overcome in a privileged somatic cell state and suggest that cell-cycle acceleration toward a critical threshold is an important bottleneck for reprogramming.

We further showed that the polo box domain was able to confer nuclear import of beta-galactosidase in vivo and GST-EGFP in vitro. The import carriers transportin and importin alpha were found to interact with the polo box domain directly in a Ran-GTP sensitive manner. These results indicate the presence of a nuclear localization signal in the polo box domain. A 38 amino acid sequence with the function of nuclear localization signal was identified to interact with transportin. Our findings demonstrated that a transportin-dependent nuclear localization signal is present in the polo box domain of Plk1, possibly required for efficient nuclear import. Showing little similarity to the M9 sequence, the 38 amino acid sequence identified here likely represents a novel nuclear localization signal.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell migration requires coordinated formation of focal adhesions (FAs) and assembly and contraction of the actin cytoskeleton. Nonmuscle myosin II (MII) is a critical mediator of contractility and FA dynamics in cell migration. Signaling downstream of the small GTPase Rac1 also regulates FA and actin dynamics, but its role in regulation of MII during migration is less clear. RESULTS: We found that Rac1 promotes association of MIIA with FA. Live-cell imaging showed that, whereas most MIIA at the leading edge assembled into dorsal contractile arcs, a substantial subset assembled in or was captured within maturing FA, and this behavior was promoted by active Rac1. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation was necessary and sufficient for integrin- and Rac1-dependent phosphorylation of MIIA heavy chain (HC) on serine1916 (S1916) and recruitment to FA. S1916 phosphorylation of MIIA HC and localization in FA was enhanced during cell spreading and ECM stiffness mechanosensing, suggesting upregulation of this pathway during physiological Rac1 activation. Phosphomimic and nonphosphorylatable MIIA HC mutants demonstrated that S1916 phosphorylation was necessary and sufficient for the capture and assembly of MIIA minifilaments in FA. S1916 phosphorylation was also sufficient to promote the rapid assembly of FAs to enhance cell migration and for the modulation of traction force, spreading, and migration by ECM stiffness. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals for the first time that Rac1 and integrin activation regulates MIIA HC phosphorylation through a PKC-dependent mechanism that promotes MIIA association with FAs and acts as a critical modulator of cell migration and mechanosensing.},

  abstract = {The recent development of hormonal therapy that blocks estrogen synthesis represents a major advance in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, cancer cells often acquire adaptations resulting in resistance. A recent report reveals that estrogen starvation-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells requires BIK, an apoptotic BH3-only protein located primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Searching for novel partners that interact with BIK at the ER, we discovered that BIK selectively forms complex with the glucose-regulated protein GRP78/BiP, a major ER chaperone with prosurvival properties naturally induced in the tumor microenvironment. GRP78 overexpression decreases apoptosis of 293T cells induced by ER-targeted BIK. For estrogen-dependent MCF-7/BUS breast cancer cells, overexpression of GRP78 inhibits estrogen starvation-induced BAX activation, mitochondrial permeability transition, and consequent apoptosis. Further, knockdown of endogenous GRP78 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitizes MCF-7/BUS cells to estrogen starvation-induced apoptosis. This effect was substantially reduced when the expression of BIK was also reduced by siRNA. Our results provide the first evidence that GRP78 confers resistance to estrogen starvation-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells via a novel mechanism mediated by BIK. These results further suggest that GRP78 expression level in the tumor cells may serve as a prognostic marker for responsiveness to hormonal therapy based on estrogen starvation and that combination therapy targeting GRP78 may enhance efficacy and reduce resistance.},

In this study, we demonstrated that disruption of the FoxM1B Cdk1/2 phosphorylation site at Thr residue 596 significantly reduced both FoxM1B transcriptional activity and Cdk phosphorylation of the FoxM1B T596A mutant protein in vivo. Retention of this FoxM1B 596 Cdk phosphorylation site was found to be essential for recruiting the histone acetyltransferase CREB binding protein (CBP) to the FoxM1B transcriptional activation domain. Consistent with these findings, dominant negative Cdk1 protein significantly reduced FoxM1B transcriptional activity and inhibited FoxM1B recruitment of the CBP coactivator protein. Likewise, Cdc25B-mediated stimulation of Cdk activity together with elevated levels of the CBP coactivator protein provided a 6.2-fold synergistic increase in FoxM1B transcriptional activity. Furthermore, mutation of the FoxM1B Leu 641 residue within an LXL motif (residues 639 to 641) inhibited recruitment of Cdk-cyclin complexes and caused significant reduction in both FoxM1B transcriptional activity and in vivo Cdk phosphorylation of the FoxM1B Thr 596 residue. We demonstrated that FoxM1B transcriptional activity requires binding of either S-phase or M-phase Cdk-cyclin complexes to mediate efficient Cdk phosphorylation of the FoxM1B Thr 596 residue, which is essential for recruitment of p300/CBP coactivator proteins.},

Here, we show that TGF-{$\beta$}-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation requires members of two classes of type I receptor, TGFBR1 and ACVR1, and establish a new paradigm for receptor activation where TGFBR1 phosphorylates and activates ACVR1, which phosphorylates SMAD1/5. We demonstrate the biological significance of this pathway by showing that approximately a quarter of the TGF-{$\beta$}-induced transcriptome depends on SMAD1/5 signaling, with major early transcriptional targets being the ID genes. Finally, we show that TGF-{$\beta$}-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition requires signaling via both the SMAD3 and SMAD1/5 pathways, with SMAD1/5 signaling being essential to induce ID1. Therefore, combinatorial signaling via both SMAD pathways is essential for the full TGF-{$\beta$}-induced transcriptional program and physiological responses.},

Since the invasiveness of breast cancer cells is also influenced by p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) signaling, we investigated Pak1's potential mechanistic role in the regulation of Snail functions. We found for the first time that Pak1 promotes transcription repression activity of Snail from E-cadherin, occludin, and aromatase promoters. Pak1 regulates the repressor activity of Snail by phosphorylating on Ser(246). Pak1 phosphorylation of Snail supports Snail's accumulation in the nucleus as well as its repressor functions. A Ser(246)Ala substitution in Snail or Pak1 knockdown by short interference RNA blocked Pak1-mediated Snail phosphorylation, leading to increased cytoplasmic accumulation of Snail and attenuation of Snail repressor activity in breast cancer cells.

Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we demonstrate that in healthy cells, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-DRP1 recycles between the cytoplasm and mitochondria with a half-time of 50 s. Strikingly, during apoptotic cell death, YFP-DRP1 undergoes a transition from rapid recycling to stable membrane association. The rapid cycling phase that characterizes the early stages of apoptosis is independent of Bax/Bak. However, after Bax recruitment to the mitochondrial membranes but before the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, YFP-DRP1 becomes locked on the membrane, resulting in undetectable fluorescence recovery. This second phase in DRP1 cycling is dependent on the presence of Bax/Bak but independent of hFis1 and mitochondrial fragmentation. Coincident with Bax activation, we detect a Bax/Bak-dependent stimulation of small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 conjugation to DRP1, a modification that correlates with the stable association of DRP1 with mitochondrial membranes. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the apoptotic machinery regulates the biochemical properties of DRP1 during cell death.},

Cdt1 is a novel component of the pre-replicative complex and plays a role in loading the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 2-7 complex onto chromatin. Cdt1 activity is inhibited by geminin, which is essential for the G(2)/M transition in metazoan cells. To understand the molecular basis of the Cdt1-geminin regulatory mechanism in mammalian cells, we cloned and expressed the mouse Cdt1 homologue cDNA in bacterial cells and purified mouse Cdt1 to near homogeneity. We found by yeast two-hybrid analysis that mouse Cdt1 associates with geminin, MCM6, and origin recognition complex 2. MCM6 interacts with the Cdt1 carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 407-477), which is conserved among eukaryotes, whereas geminin associates with the Cdt1 central region (amino acids 177-380), which is conserved only in metazoans. In addition, we found that Cdt1 can bind DNA in a sequence-, strand-, and conformation-independent manner. The Cdt1 DNA binding domain overlaps with the geminin binding domain, and the binding of Cdt1 to DNA is inhibited by geminin. Taken together, we have defined structural domains and novel biochemical properties for mouse Cdt1 that suggest that Cdt1 behaves as an intrinsic DNA binding factor in the pre-replicative complex.},

It is induced in human cells in response to several stress stimuli, including genotoxic stress (radiation, doxorubicin) and overexpression of E1A or p53 but not by ER stress pathways resulting from protein malfolding. BIK initiates an early release of Ca2+ from ER upstream of the activation of effector caspases. Release of the mobile ER Ca2+ stores in baby mouse kidney cells doubly deficient in BAX and BAK, on the other hand, is resistant to BIK but is sensitive to ectopic BAK. Over-expression of p53 stimulates recruitment of BAK to the ER, and both its recruitment and assembly into higher order structures is inhibited by BIK small interfering RNA. Employing small interfering RNA knockdowns, we also demonstrated that release of ER Ca2+ and mitochondrial apoptosis in human epithelial cells requires BIK and that a Ca2+-regulated target, the dynamin-related GTPase DRP1, is involved in p53-induced mitochondrial fission and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. Endogenous cellular BIK, therefore, regulates a BAX,BAK-dependent ER pathway that contributes to mitochondrial apoptosis.},

  abstract = {The ability of a genotype to change its phenotype was once considered rather a nuisance -- making it difficult to define a genotype. This led to the idea that there was a problem called 'instability'. But quite early it was recognized that stability was under genetic control, and was a character like other attributes of an individual. From this realization came the idea that there were two sides to the character of 'instability', and that the ability to change could be important. This ability was thus given the title of 'plasticity'. Once recognized, it became clear from surveys of different species and populations that plasticity can (i) be a complex character, and (ii) be selected to fit species to the particular demands of different environments. For plants, which cannot meet variations in environment like animals by behavioural responses, phenotypic plasticity can be very important. Plants should therefore be valuable tools for unravelling the mechanisms of plasticity whilst also demonstrating its contribution to fitness experimentally. We ought also to be able to demonstrate that appropriate genetic variability is available through which complex responses can be built up by selection. Genes must exist not only to determine character means, but also to determine character response, which adds interesting complexity to our ideas about evolution.},

At the G1-S transition, hEmi1 is transcriptionally induced by the E2F transcription factor, much like cyclin A. hEmi1 overexpression accelerates S phase entry and can override a G1 block caused by overexpression of Cdh1 or the E2F-inhibitor p105 retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Depleting cells of hEmi1 through RNA interference prevents accumulation of cyclin A and inhibits S phase entry.

The boundary position remained invariant when different stimuli were used or upstream signaling components perturbed. We further identified Rasa2 as a negative feedback regulator that links PI3K to Ras, placing the stochastically distributed pERK-pAKT signals close to the decision boundary. This allows for uniform NGF stimuli to create a subpopulation of cells that differentiates with each cycle of proliferation. Thus, by linking a complex signaling system to a simpler intermediate response map, cells gain unique integration and control capabilities to balance cell number expansion with differentiation.},

It has been found previously that cdc25 is the tyrosine phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating and activating cdc2-cyclin B. In Xenopus eggs and early embryos a cdc25 homologue undergoes periodic phosphorylation and activation. Here we show that the catalytic activity of human cdc25-C phosphatase is also activated directly by phosphorylation in mitotic cells. Phosphorylation of cdc25-C in mitotic HeLa extracts or by cdc2-cyclin B increases its catalytic activity. cdc25-C is not a substrate of the cyclin A-associated kinases. cdc25-C is able to activate cdc2-cyclin B1 in Xenopus egg extracts and to induce Xenopus oocyte maturation, but only after stable thiophosphorylation. This demonstrates that phosphorylation of cdc25-C is required for the activation of cdc2-cyclin B and entry into M-phase. Together, these studies offer a plausible explanation for the rapid activation of cdc2-cyclin B at the onset of mitosis and the self-amplification of MPF observed in vivo.},

We rationally introduce mutations within the TATA region of an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL1 promoter and measure promoter responses that can be characterized as being either highly variable and rapid or steady and slow. We computationally illustrate how a stable transcription scaffold can result in "bursts" of gene expression, enabling rapid individual cell responses in the transient and increased cell-cell variability at steady state. We experimentally verify computational predictions that the rapid response and increased cell-cell variability enabled by TATA-containing promoters confer a clear benefit in the face of an acute environmental stress.},

In particular, ERK~signaling contributes to repression of the E-cadherin gene during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The CtBP transcriptional co-repressor is also involved in gene silencing of E-cadherin. However, the functional relationship between ERK signaling and CtBP is unknown. Here, we identified an ERK substrate, designated MCRIP1, which bridges ERK signaling and CtBP-mediated gene silencing. CtBP is recruited to promoter elements of target genes by interacting with the DNA-binding transcriptional repressor ZEB1. We found that MCRIP1 binds to CtBP, thereby competitively inhibiting CtBP-ZEB1 interaction. When phosphorylated by ERK, MCRIP1 dissociates from CtBP, allowing CtBP to interact with ZEB1. In this manner, the CtBP co-repressor complex is recruited to, and silences, the E-cadherin promoter by inducing chromatin modifications. Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism underlying ERK-induced epigenetic gene silencing during EMT and its dysregulation in cancer.},

  abstract = {While phenotypic endothelial heterogeneity is well documented in peripheral organs, it is only now being explored in the brain. We used confocal imaging of thick sections of rat brain to qualitatively and quantitatively examine the expression of two key markers of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the rat, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and endothelial barrier antigen (EBA). We found that these markers were not uniformly distributed throughout the whole vasculature of the cortex and hippocampus. P-glycoprotein displayed a gradient of expression from an almost undetectable level in large penetrating arterioles to a high and uniform level in capillaries and venules. While EBA was lacking in all cerebral arterioles, regardless of their size, its expression varied greatly among endothelial cells in capillaries and venules, yielding a striking mosaic pattern. A detailed quantitative analysis of the distribution of these markers at the single cell level in capillaries is provided. These results challenge the view of a uniform BBB and suggest that regulatory mechanisms might differentially modulate BBB features not only among arterioles/capillaries/venules but also at the single cell level within the capillaries. Hypotheses are made regarding the underlying mechanisms and physiopathological consequences of this heterogeneity.},

An important challenge is to decipher how these functions are coordinated in health and disease. We approach this by drawing on dynamical systems theory. We posit that distinct phenotype-combinations are generated by interactions among robust regulatory switches, each in control of a discrete set of phenotypic outcomes. First, we demonstrate the advantage of characterizing multi-switch regulatory systems in terms of their constituent switches by building a multiswitch cell cycle model which points to novel, testable interactions critical for early G2/M commitment to division. Second, we define quantitative measures of dynamical modularity, namely that global cell states are discrete combinations of switch-level phenotypes. Finally, we formulate three general principles that govern the way coupled switches coordinate their function.},

We carried out an exhaustive computational analysis on network topologies in relation to a patterning function in Drosophila embryogenesis. We found that whereas the vast majority of topologies can either not perform the required function or only do so very fragilely, a small fraction of topologies emerges as particularly robust for the function. The topology adopted by Drosophila, that of the segment polarity network, is a top ranking one among all topologies with no direct autoregulation. Furthermore, we found that all robust topologies are modular-each being a combination of three kinds of modules. These modules can be traced back to three subfunctions of the patterning function, and their combinations provide a combinatorial variability for the robust topologies. Our results suggest that the requirement of functional robustness drastically reduces the choices of viable topology to a limited set of modular combinations among which nature optimizes its choice under evolutionary and other biological constraints.},

Its unfathomable complexity defies the standard mode of explanation that is deeply rooted in molecular biology thinking: the reduction of observables to linear deterministic molecular pathways that are tacitly taken as chains of causation. Such culture of proximate explanation that uses qualitative arguments, simple arrow-arrow schemes or metaphors persists despite the ceaseless accumulation of 'omics' data and the rise of systems biology that now offers precise conceptual tools to explain emergent cell behaviours from gene networks. To facilitate the embrace of the principles of physics and mathematics that underlie such systems and help to bridge the gap between the formal description of theorists and the intuition of experimental biologists, we discuss in qualitative terms three perspectives outside the realm of their familiar linear-deterministic view: (i) state space (ii), high-dimensionality and (iii) heterogeneity. These concepts jointly offer a new vista on stem cell regulation that naturally explains many novel, counterintuitive observations and their inherent inevitability, obviating the need for ad hoc explanations of their existence based on natural selection. Hopefully, this expanded view will stimulate novel experimental designs.},

Activated Smad proteins associate with different DNA-binding cofactors for the recognition and regulation of specific target genes. Members of the forkhead box O family (FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4) play such a role in the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15Ink4b and p21Cip1. To delineate the organization of the TGF-beta response in human keratinocytes, we defined the set of genes whose activation by TGF-beta requires both FoxO and Smad functions. FoxO factors are shown to be essential for 11 of the 115 immediate gene activation responses to TGF-beta in these cells. FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 act redundantly as mediators of these effects. Smad4, which functions as a partner of receptor-phosphorylated Smad2/3, is required for all of these responses. These results define a FoxO-Smad synexpression group or group of genes that are jointly induced by a common mechanism in response to TGF-beta. In addition to p15INK4b and p21CIP1, these genes include mediators of stress responses (GADD45A, GADD45B, and IER1) and adaptive cell signaling responses (CTGF, JAG1, LEMD3, SGK, CDC42EP3, and OVOL1). Bioinformatic analysis of the promoter region of these genes reveals diverse configurations of Smad and FoxO binding elements, implying differences in the regulatory properties of this group of genes. Indeed, a subset of FoxO/Smad-dependent TGF-beta gene responses additionally require the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta. The composition of the FoxO-Smad synexpression group suggests that stress reactions and adaptive functions accompany the cytostatic response of keratinocytes to TGF-beta.},

Although recent genetic studies have shown that the Hippo pathway is regulated by the NF2 and Fat tumor suppressors, the physiological regulations of this pathway are unknown. Here we show that in mammalian cells, the transcription coactivator YAP (Yes-associated protein), is inhibited by cell density via the Hippo pathway. Phosphorylation by the Lats tumor suppressor kinase leads to cytoplasmic translocation and inactivation of the YAP oncoprotein. Furthermore, attenuation of this phosphorylation of YAP or Yorkie (Yki), the Drosophila homolog of YAP, potentiates their growth-promoting function in vivo. Moreover, YAP overexpression regulates gene expression in a manner opposite to cell density, and is able to overcome cell contact inhibition. Inhibition of YAP function restores contact inhibition in a human cancer cell line bearing deletion of Salvador (Sav), a Hippo pathway component. Interestingly, we observed that YAP protein is elevated and nuclear localized in some human liver and prostate cancers. Our observations demonstrate that YAP plays a key role in the Hippo pathway to control cell proliferation in response to cell contact.},

However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate the functional link between senescence and EMT are still elusive. We have shown here that p16INK4A -related induction of senescence is mediated through miR-141 and miR-146b-5p. These two microRNAs are up-regulated in aging human fibroblast and epithelial cells. Furthermore, miR-141 and miR146b-5p trigger cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and induce senescence in primary human fibroblasts and breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of p16INK4A . Like p16INK4A -induced senescence, miR-141/miR146b-5p-related senescence is not associated with secretory phenotype, and is mediated through the RNA binding protein AUF1. We have further demonstrated that p16INK4A and its downstream miRNA targets inhibit EMT through suppressing the EMT inducer ZEB1 in an AUF1-dependent manner. Indeed, AUF1 binds the mRNA of this gene leading to increase in its level. These results indicate that p16INK4A controls both senescence and EMT through repressing EMT-related transcription factor via miR-141/miR146b-5p and their target AUF1. This sheds more light on the molecular basis of the tumor suppressive functions of p16INK4A , which represses both the proliferative and the migratory/invasive capacities of cells. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-lambda, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks and in the decrease of precision of cell signals. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

The F-box protein beta-TrCP (beta-transducin repeat-containing protein), the substrate recognition component of the ubiquitin ligase, binds to its substrates through a conserved binding motif (phosphodegron) containing two phosphoserines, DpSGXXpS. Although Wee1A lacks this motif, phosphorylation of serines 53 and 123 (S53 and S123) of Wee1A by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and CDK, respectively, are required for binding to beta-TrCP. The sequence surrounding phosphorylated S53 (DpSAFQE) is similar to the conserved beta-TrCP-binding motif; however, the role of S123 phosphorylation (EEGFGSSpSPVK) in beta-TrCP binding was not elucidated. In the present study, we show that phosphorylation of S123 (pS123) by CDK promoted the binding of Wee1A to beta-TrCP through three independent mechanisms. The pS123 not only directly interacted with basic residues in the WD40 repeat domain of beta-TrCP but also primed phosphorylation by two independent protein kinases, Plk1 and CK2 (formerly casein kinase 2), to create two phosphodegrons on Wee1A. In the case of Plk1, S123 phosphorylation created a polo box domain-binding motif (SpSP) on Wee1A to accelerate phosphorylation of S53 by Plk1. CK2 could phosphorylate S121, but only if S123 was phosphorylated first, thereby generating the second beta-TrCP-binding site (EEGFGpS121). Using a specific inhibitor of CK2, we showed that the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of Wee1A is important for the proper onset of mitosis.},

Commitment to early mitotic events depends on the activation of a centrosomal pool of CDK1-cyclin-B1, and CDC25B is thought to be involved in initiating this centrosomal CDK1-cyclin-B1 activity. Centrosome-associated checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) has been proposed to contribute to the proper timing of a normal cell division cycle by inhibiting the activation of the centrosomal pool of CDK1. Here, we show that CDC25B is phosphorylated by CHK1 in vitro on multiple residues, including S230 and S563. We demonstrate these phosphorylations occur in vivo and that they are dependent on CHK1 activity. S230 CHK1-mediated phosphorylation is detected in cell extracts during S phase and G2 phase in the absence of DNA damage. We show that the S230-phosphorylated form of CDC25B is located at the centrosome from early S phase until mitosis. Furthermore, mutation of S230 to alanine increases the mitotic-inducing activity of CDC25B. Our results support a model in which, under normal cell cycle conditions and in the absence of DNA damage, CHK1 constitutively phosphorylates CDC25B during interphase and thus prevents the premature initiation of mitosis by negatively regulating the activity of CDC25B at the centrosome.},

Aberrant expression of LEF1 is implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. LEF1's activity in particular cancer cell types, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and colorectal cancer (CRC), makes it a valuable biomarker in predicting patient prognosis. Additionally, due to aberrant LEF1 activity resulting in cancer progression, knockdown and inhibition treatments designed to target LEF1 have proven effective in alleviating cancer growth, migration, and invasion in CLL, CRC, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In prostate cancer cells, LEF1 promotes androgen receptor expression and activity in an androgen-independent manner, ultimately increasing prostate cancer growth regardless of androgen ablation therapy. In this review, we review LEF1 regulation, its role in tumorigenesis in several cancer types, and its clinical value as a biomarker for predicting prognoses and as a target for treatment.},

  abstract = {Since their initial discovery in yeast, cyclin-dependent kinases have proven to be universal regulators of the cell cycle in all eukaryotes. In unicellular eukaryotes, cell cycle progression is principally governed by one catalytic subunit (cyclin-dependent kinase) that pairs with cell cycle-specific regulatory subunits known as cyclins. Progression through a specific phase of the cell cycle is under the control of a specific class of cyclin. Cell cycle control in multicellular eukaryotes has an additional layer of complexity, as multiple CDKs and cyclins are required. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in the area of cyclins and CDKs, with emphasis on the role of the mammalian proteins in cell cycle control at the cellular and at the organismal level. Many recent surprises have come to light recently as a result of genetic manipulation of cells and mice, and these findings suggest that our understanding of the intricacies of the cell cycle is still rudimentary at best.},

  abstract = {The function of the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD is regulated by phosphorylation of two sites, serine-112 (Ser-112) and serine-136 (Ser-136). Phosphorylation at either site results in loss of the ability of BAD to heterodimerize with the survival proteins BCL-XL or BCL-2. Phosphorylated BAD binds to 14-3-3 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm. It has been shown that phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-136 is mediated by the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt-1/PKB which is downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The signaling process leading to phophorylation of BAD at Ser-112 has not been identified. In this study, we show that phosphorylation of the two serine residues of BAD is differentially regulated. While Ser-136 phosphorylation is concordant with activation of Akt, Ser-112 phosphorylation does not correlate with Akt activation. Instead, we demonstrate that activated Ras and Raf, which are upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), stimulate selective phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-112. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Ser-112, but not Ser-136 requires activation of the MAPK pathway as the MEK inhibitor, PD 98059, blocks EGF-, as well as activated Ras- or Raf-mediated phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-112. Therefore, the PI3K-Akt and Ras-MAPK pathways converge at BAD by mediating phosphorylation of distinct serine residues.},

Mitofusin (Mfn) proteins regulate the biogenesis and maintenance of the mitochondrial network, and when inactivated, cause a failure in the mitochondrial architecture and decreases in oxidative capacity and glucose oxidation. Exercise increases muscle mitochondrial content, size, oxidative capacity and aerobic glucose oxidation. To address if Mfn proteins are implicated in these exercise-induced responses, we measured Mfn1 and Mfn2 mRNA levels, pre-, post-, 2 and 24 h post-exercise. Additionally, we measured the expression levels of transcriptional regulators that control mitochondrial biogenesis and functions, including PGC-1alpha, NRF-1, NRF-2 and the recently implicated ERRalpha. We show that Mfn1, Mfn2, NRF-2 and COX IV mRNA were increased 24 h post-exercise, while PGC-1alpha and ERRalpha mRNA increased 2 h post-exercise. Finally, using in vitro cellular assays, we demonstrate that Mfn2 gene expression is driven by a PGC-1alpha programme dependent on ERRalpha. The PGC-1alpha/ERRalpha-mediated induction of Mfn2 suggests a role of these two factors in mitochondrial fusion. Our results provide evidence that PGC-1alpha not only mediates the increased expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes but also mediates alterations in mitochondrial architecture in response to aerobic exercise in humans.},

Localization of the RhoGEF Ect2 to the central spindle at anaphase promotes local activation of the RhoA GTPase, which induces assembly and ingression of the contractile ring. Here we have used BI 2536, an inhibitor of the mitotic kinase Plk1, to analyze the functions of this enzyme during late mitosis in human cells. We show that Plk1 acts after Cdk1 inactivation and independently from Aurora B to promote RhoA accumulation at the equator, contractile ring formation, and cleavage furrow ingression. Inhibition of Plk1 abolishes the interaction of Ect2 with its activator and midzone anchor, HsCyk-4, thereby preventing localization of Ect2 to the central spindle. We propose that late mitotic Plk1 activity promotes recruitment of Ect2 to the central spindle, triggering the initiation of cytokinesis and contributing to cleavage plane specification in human cells.},

  abstract = {Epithelial cells respond to their physical neighborhood with mechano-sensitive behaviors required for development and tissue maintenance. These include anchorage dependence, matrix stiffness-dependent proliferation, contact inhibition of proliferation and migration, and collective migration that balances cell crawling with the maintenance of cell junctions. While required for development and tissue repair, these coordinated responses to the microenvironment also contribute to cancer metastasis. Predictive models of the signaling networks that coordinate these behaviors are critical in controlling cell behavior to halt disease. Here we propose a Boolean regulatory network model that synthesizes mechanosensitive signaling that links anchorage to a matrix of varying stiffness and cell density sensing to contact inhibition, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Our model can reproduce anchorage dependence and anoikis, detachment-induced cytokinesis errors, the effect of matrix stiffness on proliferation, and contact inhibition of proliferation and migration by two mechanisms that converge on the YAP transcription factor. In addition, we offer testable predictions related to cell cycle-dependent anoikis sensitivity, the molecular requirements for abolishing contact inhibition, and substrate stiffness dependent expression of the catalytic subunit of PI3K. Moreover, our model predicts heterogeneity in migratory vs. non-migratory phenotypes in sub-confluent monolayers, and co-inhibition but semi-independent induction of proliferation vs. migration as a function of cell density and mitogenic stimulation. Our model serves as a stepping-stone towards modeling mechanosensitive routes to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, capturing the effects of the mesenchymal state on anoikis resistance, and understanding the balance between migration versus proliferation at each stage of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition.},

Here, we show that BH3-only BIK activates this pathway at the ER in intact cells, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation but little release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. The BIK-induced transformations in mitochondria are dynamic in nature and involve DRP1-dependent remodelling and opening of cristae, where the major stores of cytochrome c reside. This novel function for DRP1 is distinct from its recognized role in regulating mitochondrial fission. Selective permeabilization of the outer membrane with digitonin confirmed that BIK stimulation results in mobilization of intramitochondrial cytochrome c. Of note, BIK can cooperate with a weak BH3-only protein that targets mitochondria, such as NOXA, to activate BAX by a mechanism that is independent of DRP1 enzyme activity. When expressed together, BIK and NOXA cause rapid release of mobilized cytochrome c and activation of caspases.},

  abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has attracted interest as an anticancer treatment, when used in conjunction with standard chemotherapy. We investigated the mechanistic basis for combining low-dose TRAIL with microtubule-targeting agents that invoke the mitotic checkpoint. Treatment of T98G and HCT116 cells with nocodazole alone resulted in a robust mitotic block with initially little cell death; low levels of cell death were also seen with TRAIL alone at 10 ng/mL final concentration. In contrast, the addition of low-dose TRAIL to nocodazole was associated with maximally increased caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activation, which efficiently abrogated the mitotic delay and markedly increased cell death. In contrast, the abrogation of mitotic checkpoint and increased cell death were blocked by inhibitors of caspase-8 and caspase-9 or pan-caspase inhibitor. The addition of TRAIL to either nocodazole or paclitaxel (Taxol) reduced levels of the mitotic checkpoint proteins BubR1 and Bub1. BubR1 mutated for the caspase cleavage sites, but not wild-type BubR1, was resistant to cleavage induced by TRAIL added to nocodazole, and partially blocked the checkpoint abrogation. These results suggest that adding a relatively low concentration of TRAIL to antimicrotubule agents markedly increases complete caspase activation. This in turn accentuates degradation of spindle checkpoint proteins such as BubR1 and Bub1, contributes to abrogation of the mitotic checkpoint, and induces cancer cell death. These results suggest that TRAIL may increase the anticancer efficacy of microtubule-targeting drugs.},

Although many of the molecular genetic factors are now known, the system level regulation of growth is still poorly understood. A simple form of inhibition of cell proliferation is encountered in vitro in normally differentiating epithelial cell cultures and is known as "contact inhibition." The study presented here provides a quantitative characterization of contact inhibition dynamics on tissue-wide and single cell levels. Using long-term tracking of cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney cells we demonstrate that inhibition of cell division in a confluent monolayer follows inhibition of cell motility and sets in when mechanical constraint on local expansion causes divisions to reduce cell area. We quantify cell motility and cell cycle statistics in the low density confluent regime and their change across the transition to epithelial morphology which occurs with increasing cell density. We then study the dynamics of cell area distribution arising through reductive division, determine the average mitotic rate as a function of cell size, and demonstrate that complete arrest of mitosis occurs when cell area falls below a critical value. We also present a simple computational model of growth mechanics which captures all aspects of the observed behavior. Our measurements and analysis show that contact inhibition is a consequence of mechanical interaction and constraint rather than interfacial contact alone, and define quantitative phenotypes that can guide future studies of molecular mechanisms underlying contact inhibition.},

Here, we show that FoxM1 is transcriptionally active during a DNA-damage-induced G2 arrest and is essential for checkpoint recovery. Paradoxically, Cdk activity, although reduced after checkpoint activation, is required to maintain FoxM1-dependent transcription during the arrest and for expression of pro-mitotic targets such as cyclin A, cyclin B and Plk1. Indeed, we find that cells need to retain sufficient levels of Cdk activity during the DNA-damage response to maintain cellular competence to recover from a DNA-damaging insult.},

  abstract = {The Hippo-YAP pathway is a central regulator of cell contact inhibition, proliferation and death. There are conflicting reports regarding the role of Angiomotin (Amot) in regulating this pathway. While some studies suggest a YAP-inhibitory function other studies indicate Amot is required for YAP activity. Here, we describe an Amot-dependent complex comprised of Amot, YAP and Merlin. The phosphorylation of Amot at Serine 176 shifts localization of this complex to the plasma membrane, where it associates with the tight-junction proteins Pals1/PATJ and E-cadherin. Conversely, hypophosphorylated Amot shifts localization of the complex to the nucleus, where it facilitates the association of YAP and TEAD, induces transcriptional activation of YAP target genes and promotes YAP-dependent cell proliferation. We propose that phosphorylation of AmotS176 is a critical post-translational modification that suppresses YAP's ability to promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by altering the subcellular localization of an essential YAP co-factor.           ,              Cells in animals and other multi-cellular organisms need to know when and where they should grow and divide. Individual cells communicate with their surrounding environment and each other via signaling pathways such as the Hippo-YAP pathway, which stimulates cells to grow and therefore influences the size of organs. When the Hippo part of the pathway is active it causes a protein known as YAP to move out of a compartment in the cell called the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, YAP helps to activate genes that promote cell growth. If the Hippo pathway can no longer respond to cues from the environment, YAP becomes over-active and can contribute to the development of various cancers. Therefore researchers are trying to better understand how it is regulated.             Many signals both from inside and outside the cell influence YAP activity. For example, some signals block YAP from entering the nucleus, whereas others cause YAP to be broken down entirely. Several studies have recently identified a signal protein called angiomotin as a regulator of YAP. However, the studies provide conflicting reports as to whether angiomotin promotes or inhibits cell growth.             Like many other proteins, angiomotin can be tagged with a small molecule called a phosphate group that can alter its activity. Moleirinho, Hoxha et al. studied human cells containing versions of angiomotin that mimic different forms of the protein with or without the phosphate. The experiments indicate that when a phosphate is attached at a particular position (known as serine 176), angiomotin predominantly interacts with YAP and another protein called Merlin at the cell surface. On the other hand, when angiomotin does not have a phosphate attached to it, all three proteins can move into the nucleus, where YAP is able to activate genes and promote cell growth.             Overall, these findings indicate that adding a phosphate group to angiomotin can act as a switch to regulate where in the cell it and YAP are found and thus, whether YAP is active. Future experiments will investigate which enzymes add the phosphate group to serine 176, and when they are able to do so.},

The identification of higher eukaryotic homologs of several ORC components suggests a universal role for this complex in DNA replication. We now demonstrate that the expression of one of these homologs is regulated by cell proliferation. Expression of the human Orc1 gene (HsOrc1) is low in quiescent cells, and it is then dramatically induced upon stimulation of cell growth. In contrast, expression of the HsOrc2 gene does not appear to be similarly regulated. We have isolated the promoter that regulates HsOrc1 transcription, and we show that the promoter confers cell growth-dependent expression. We also demonstrate that the cell growth control is largely the consequence of E2F-dependent negative transcription control in quiescent cells. Activation of HsOrc1 transcription following growth stimulation requires G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activity, and forced E2F1 expression can bypass this requirement. These results thus provide a direct link between the initiation of DNA replication and the cell growth regulatory pathway involving G1 cyclin-dependent kinases, the Rb tumor suppressor, and E2F.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ras pathway mutation leads to induction and Erk phosphorylation and activation of the Ets1 transcription factor. Ets1 in turn induces cyclin E and cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) 2 to drive cell cycle progression. Ets1 also induces expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor Zeb1, and thereby links Ras mutation to EMT, which is thought to drive tumor invasion. Ras pathway mutations are detected by the Rb1 tumor suppression pathway, and mutation or inactivation of the Rb1 pathway is required for EMT. RESULTS: We examined linkage between Rb1, Ets1 and Zeb1. We found that an Rb1-E2F complex binds the Ets1 promoter and constitutively limits Ets1 expression. But, Rb1 repression of Zeb1 provides the major impact of Rb1 on Ets1 expression. We link Rb1 repression of Zeb1 to induction of miR-200 family members, which in turn target Ets1 mRNA. These findings suggest that Ets1 and Zeb1 comprise an amplification loop that is dependent upon miR-200 and regulated by Rb1. Thus, induction of Ets1 when the Rb1 pathway is lost may contribute to deregulated cell cycle progression through Ets1 induction of cyclin E and cdk2. Consistent with such an amplification loop, we correlate expression of Ets1 and Zeb1 in mouse and human lung adenocarcinoma. In addition we demonstrate that Ets1 expression in thymocytes is also dependent upon Zeb1. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results provide evidence of an Rb1-dependent Ets1-Zeb1 amplification loop in thymocyte differentiation and tumor invasion.},

This finding was interesting because rictor, originally identified as a regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics, is also a component of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), a complex implicated in Akt phosphorylation. These functions overlap with known ILK functions. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses confirmed this interaction, and ILK and rictor colocalized in membrane ruffles and leading edges of cancer cells. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed a direct interaction between the NH(2)- and COOH-terminal domains of rictor and the ILK kinase domain. Depletion of ILK and rictor in breast and prostate cancer cell lines resulted in inhibition of Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis, whereas, in several cell lines, depletion of mTOR increased Akt phosphorylation. Akt and Ser(473)P-Akt were detected in ILK immunoprecipitates and small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of rictor, but not mTOR, inhibited the amount of Ser(473)P-Akt in the ILK complex. Expression of the NH(2)-terminal (1-398 amino acids) rictor domain also resulted in the inhibition of ILK-associated Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation. These data show that rictor regulates the ability of ILK to promote Akt phosphorylation and cancer cell survival.},

Although SFKs have been shown to associate with the mitotic spindle, the role of SFKs in mitotic spindle formation remains unclear. Here, we show that c-Src promotes proper spindle orientation in early prometaphase. Src localizes close to spindle poles in a manner independent of Src kinase activity. Three-dimensional analyses showed that Src inhibition induced spindle misorientation, exhibiting a tilting spindle in early prometaphase. Spindle misorientation is frequently seen in SYF cells, which harbor triple knock-out mutations of c-Src, c-Yes, and Fyn, and reintroduction of c-Src but not Fyn into SYF cells rescued spindle misorientation. Spindle misorientation was also observed upon Src inhibition under conditions in which Aurora B was inhibited. Inducible expression of c-Src promoted a properly oriented bipolar spindle, which was suppressed by Src inhibition. Aster formation was severely inhibited in SYF cells upon Aurora B inhibition, which was rescued by reintroduction of c-Src into SYF cells. Furthermore, reintroduction of c-Src facilitated microtubule regrowth from cold-induced depolymerization and accelerated M phase progression. These results suggest that c-Src is involved in spindle orientation through centrosome-mediated aster formation.},

Previous studies have suggested that FOXM1 regulates CDC25A gene transcription, but the mechanism remains unknown. Here, we provide evidence that FOXM1 directly regulates CDC25A gene transcription via direct promoter binding and indirect activation of E2F-dependent pathways. Prior literature reported that CDC25B and CDC25C activate CDK1/cyclinB complexes in order to enable phosphorylation of FOXM1. It was unknown if CDC25A functions in a similar manner. We report that FOXM1 transcriptional activity is synergistically enhanced when co-expressed with CDC25A. The increase is dependent upon CDK1 phosphorylation of FOXM1 at T600, T611 and T620 residues. We also report a novel protein interaction between FOXM1 and CDC25A via the C-terminus of FOXM1. We demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Thr 600 and Thr 611 residues of FOXM1 enhanced this interaction, and that the interaction is dependent upon CDC25A phosphatase activity.

This change occurs in BECs undergoing tubulogenesis in fibrin, collagen or Matrigel assays, but is independent of tube formation per se, because it is not inhibited by a metalloproteinase inhibitor that blocks tubulogenesis. It is also reversible, since cells removed from 3D tubules revert to a BEC expression profile upon monolayer culture. Induction of the lymphatic-like phenotype is partially inhibited by co-culture of HUVECs with perivascular cells.

  abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is often resistant to conventional chemotherapy and thus requires novel treatment regimens. Here, we investigated the effects of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in combination with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) or agonistic TRAIL receptor 1 (DR4)-specific monoclonal antibody, AY4, on sensitization of TRAIL- and AY4-resistant human HNSCC cell lines. Combination treatment of HNSCC cells synergistically induced apoptotic cell death accompanied by caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation and Bid cleavage into truncated Bid (tBid). Generation and accumulation of tBid through the cooperative action of MG132 with TRAIL or AY4 and Bik accumulation through MG132-mediated proteasome inhibition are critical to the synergistic apoptosis. In HNSCC cells, Bak was constrained by Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L), but not by Bcl-2. Conversely, Bax did not interact with Mcl-1, Bcl-X(L), or Bcl-2. Importantly, tBid plays a major role in Bax activation, and Bik indirectly activates Bak by displacing it from Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L), pointing to the synergistic mechanism of the combination treatment. In addition, knockdown of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L) significantly sensitized HNSCC cells to TRAIL and AY4 as a single agent, suggesting that Bak constraint by Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L) is an important resistance mechanism of TRAIL receptor-mediated apoptotic cell death. Our results provide a novel molecular mechanism for the potent synergy between MG132 proteasome inhibitor and TRAIL receptor agonists in HNSCC cells, suggesting that the combination of these agents may offer a new therapeutic strategy for HNSCC treatment.},

By developing a potent inhibitor of miR-200 family members (TuD-141/200c), the expression of which is strictly regulatable by the Tet (tetracycline)-On system, we found using a human colorectal cell line, HCT116, that several direct gene target mRNAs (Zeb1/Zeb2, ESRP1, FN1and FHOD1) of miR-200 family were elevated with distinct kinetics. Prompt induction of the transcriptional suppressors, Zeb1/Zeb2 in turn reduced the expression levels of miR-200c/-141 locus, EpCAM, ESRP1 and E-Cad. The loss of ESRP1 subsequently switched the splicing isoforms of CD44 and p120 catenin mRNAs to mesenchymal type. Importantly, within 9 days after the release from the inhibition of miR-200 family, all of the expression changes in the 14 genes observed in this study returned to their original levels in the epithelial cells. This suggests that the inherent epithelial plasticity is supported by a weak retention of key regulatory gene expression in either the epithelial or mesenchymal states through epigenetic regulation.},

SAC proteins are deeply involved in correct cell divisions, but some of these, such as mitotic arrest-deficient proteins (Mad1 and Mad2), are critical. Mad1 and Mad2 are involved in preventing "wrong" cellular divisions which lead to cellular aneuploidy and are recognized as inductors of genetic disorders, as well as activators of oncoproteins. To clarify aneuploidy involvement in the evolution of cancer or other genetic disorders, structural and functional specificity of spindle checkpoint proteins have been analyzed, but the process is still poorly understood. In order to better understand SAC proteins involvement in initiation of cancer and other genetic disorders, here we review studies that conducted to relevant structural and functional information regarding these proteins. The results of these studies suggest that minor changes in structure and functionality of SAC proteins are able to generate aneuploidy. Therefore, a deeper understanding of Mad1 and Mad2 structural changes obtained by experimental and theoretical studies could open new perspectives of genetic medicine.},

In addition, an heretofore unidentified protease cleaves RB internally, generating fragments of 68 and 48 kDa. Internal cleavage abrogates the ability of RB to associate with E2F. To investigate the mechanism of RB internal cleavage, we developed and employed an in vitro cleavage assay. Incubation of in vitro translated (35)S-RB with apoptotic cell extracts led to RB cleavage at the C-terminus, followed by internal cleavage. The caspase peptide inhibitors z-VAD-FMK or z-DEVD-FMK blocked both cleavage events. Rapid C-terminal and internal cleavage were also observed when recombinant caspase-3 was added to (35)S-RB. Moreover, when caspase-3 was added to nonapoptotic cell extract, efficient internal cleavage of cellular RB was observed. Caspase-mediated internal cleavage occurred following RB residue aspartate(349) in the sequence DSID(349). This sequence is consistent with a DXXD recognition motif for caspase-3-like enzymes. Interestingly, we also observed RB internal cleavage in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, indicating that other caspases are capable of cleaving RB internally. Indeed, caspase-7, a member of the caspase-3 subfamily, was found to cleave (35)S-RB at both the carboxyl terminus, and following aspartate(349). By contrast, caspases that are not members of the caspase-3 subfamily failed to cleave RB. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that during apoptosis, a caspase-3-like protease is responsible for degradation and functional inactivation of RB by cleaving the protein internally following aspartate(349).},

In a high-throughput screen studying H2AX phosphorylation, we identified Wee1 as a regulator of genomic stability. Wee1 down-regulation not only induced H2AX phosphorylation but also triggered a general deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response (DDR) and caused a block in DNA replication, resulting in accumulation of cells in S phase. Wee1-deficient cells showed a decrease in replication fork speed, demonstrating the involvement of Wee1 in DNA replication. Inhibiting Wee1 in cells treated with short treatment of hydroxyurea enhanced the DDR, which suggests that Wee1 specifically protects the stability of stalled replication forks. Notably, the DDR induced by depletion of Wee1 critically depends on the Mus81-Eme1 endonuclease, and we found that codepletion of Mus81 and Wee1 abrogated the S phase delay. Importantly, Wee1 and Mus81 interact in vivo, suggesting direct regulation. Altogether, these results demonstrate a novel role of Wee1 in controlling Mus81 and DNA replication in human cells.},

PGC1{$\alpha$} exerts its neuroprotective effects by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) and functioning. However, the precise regulatory role of PGC1{$\alpha$} in the control of mitochondrial dynamics (MD) and neurotoxicity is still unknown. Here we elucidate the role of PGC1{$\alpha$}in vitro and in vivo in the regulatory context of MB and MD in response to lead (II) acetate as a relevant model of neurotoxicity. We show that there is an adaptive response (AR) to lead, orchestrated by the BAP31-calcium signalling system operating between the ER and mitochondria. We find that this hormetic response is controlled by a cell-tolerated increase of PGC1{$\alpha$} expression, which in turn induces a balanced expression of fusion/fission genes by binding to their promoters and implying its direct role in regulation of MD. However, dysregulation of PGC1{$\alpha$} expression through either stable downregulation or overexpression, renders cells more susceptible to lead insult leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death. Our data provide novel evidence that PGC1{$\alpha$} expression is a key regulator of MD and the maintenance of tolerated PGC1{$\alpha$} expression may offer a promising strategy for neuroprotective therapies.},

EGFR activates PLC-gamma1 directly and activates Akt indirectly through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Many studies have shown that the PLC-gamma1 pathway and PI3K-Akt pathway interact with each other. However, it is not known whether PLC-gamma1 binds to Akt directly. In this communication, we identified a novel interaction between PLC-gamma1 and Akt. We demonstrated that the interaction is mediated by the binding of PLC-gamma1 Src homology (SH) 3 domain to Akt proline-rich motifs. We also provide a novel model to depict how the interaction between PLC-gamma1 SH3 domain and Akt proline-rich motifs is dependent on EGF stimulation. In this model, phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1 Y783 by EGF causes the conformational change of PLC-gamma1 to allow the interaction of its SH3 domain with Akt proline-rich motifs. Furthermore, we showed that the interaction between PLC-gamma1 and Akt resulted in the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1 S1248 by Akt. Finally, we showed that the interaction between PLC-gamma1 and Akt enhanced EGF-stimulated cell motility.},

The lung-specific gene products, surfactant proteins B (SP-B) and C (SP-C), are synthesized in alveolar epithelial cells and prevent alveolar collapse.

Here we report that MCRIP1, a regulator of the CtBP transcriptional co-repressor, promotes the expression of SP-B and SP-C by preventing CtBP-mediated epigenetic gene silencing. Homozygous deficiency of Mcrip1 in mice causes fatal respiratory distress due to abnormal transcriptional repression of these surfactant proteins. We found that MCRIP1 interferes with interactions of CtBP with the lung-enriched transcriptional repressors, Foxp1 and Foxp2, thereby preventing the recruitment of the CtBP co-repressor complex to the SP-B and SP-C promoters and maintaining them in an active chromatin state. Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which cells prevent inadvertent gene silencing to ensure tissue-specific gene expression during organogenesis., Jane Weng et al. show that a MCRIP1, a regulator of the CtBP transcriptional co-repressor, promotes the expression of lung-specific surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C, which prevent alveolar collapse.

We show here that, during interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation-induced apoptosis of 32Dcl3 murine myeloid precursor cells, BAD is cleaved by a caspase(s) at its N terminus to generate a 15-kDa truncated protein. The 15-kDa truncated BAD is a more potent inducer of apoptosis than the wild-type protein, whereas a mutant BAD resistant to caspase 3 cleavage is a weak apoptosis inducer. Truncated BAD is detectable only in the mitochondrial fraction, interacts with BCL-X(L) at least as effectively as the wild-type protein, and is more potent than wild-type BAD in inducing cytochrome c release. Human BAD, which is 43 amino acids shorter than its mouse counterpart, is also cleaved by a caspase(s) upon exposure of Jurkat T cells to anti-FAS antibody, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), or TRAIL. Moreover, a truncated form of human BAD lacking the N-terminal 28 amino acids is more potent than wild-type BAD in inducing apoptosis. The generation of truncated BAD was blocked by Bcl-2 in IL-3-deprived 32Dcl3 cells but not in Jurkat T cells exposed to anti-FAS antibody, TNF-alpha, or TRAIL.

During the transition from a growth-arrested to a proliferative state, transcription of mammalian Cdc6 is regulated by E2F proteins, as revealed by a functional analysis of the human Cdc6 promoter and by the ability of exogenously expressed E2F proteins to stimulate the endogenous Cdc6 gene. Immunodepletion of Cdc6 by microinjection of anti-Cdc6 antibody blocks initiation of DNA replication in a human tumor cell line. We conclude that expression of human Cdc6 is regulated in response to mitogenic signals though transcriptional control mechanisms involving E2F proteins, and that Cdc6 is required for initiation of DNA replication in mammalian cells.},

In this study, we showed that the transcription of human Geminin and Cdt1, as well as that of MCM7, is activated by transcription factors E2F1-4, but not by factors E2F5-7. Analysis of various Geminin and Cdt1 promoter constructs showed that an E2F-responsive sequence in the vicinity of the transcription initiation site is necessary for the transcriptional activation. The promoter activity for human Geminin was activated by the E7, but not E6, oncogene of human papillomavirus type 16. While E2F1-induced activation of human Cdt1 gene transcription was suppressed by pRb, but not by p107 or p130, its E2F4-induced activation was suppressed by pRb, p107, and p130. Furthermore, the promoter activities of human Geminin and Cdt1 were demonstrated to be growth-dependent. Taken together, the results demonstrate that Geminin and Cdt1 constitute targets for various members of the E2F family of transcription factors, and that expression of Geminin and Cdt1 is perhaps mediated by the activation of a pRb/E2F pathway.},

  abstract = {Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have been found to express different numbers of molecules of specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and inactivation was developed to explain the statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that increasing the level of transcription factors increases the average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise questions about how cells are able to function in the face of such noise.},

  abstract = {GIT1 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1) has been shown to regulate focal adhesion disassembly. We previously reported that GIT1 associates with MEK1 and acts as a scaffold to enhance ERK1/2 activation. Here, we show that GIT1 co-localizes with ERK1/2 in focal adhesions and regulates cell migration in vascular smooth muscle cells, HEK293 cells, and HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence showed that GIT1 co-localized with phospho-ERK1/2 in focal adhesions after epidermal growth factor stimulation. Because Src is required for both GIT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and focal adhesion disassembly, we studied the effects of Src on GIT1-ERK1/2 interactions. PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) inhibited association of GIT1 with ERK1/2, and their co-localization in focal adhesions was dramatically decreased in SYF-/- cells. GIT1 small interfering RNA significantly inhibited ERK1/2 recruitment to and activation in focal adhesions. GIT1 small interfering RNA and mutated GIT1 lacking the MEK1 binding domain significantly decreased epidermal growth factor-stimulated cell spreading and migration, suggesting that GIT1-mediated events such as ERK1/2 activation are required for spreading and migration. In summary, the present study further supports a key role for GIT1 (a MEK1-binding protein) as a scaffold for signal transduction in focal adhesions.},

However, it is unclear as to what extent cancer cells respond to changes in the mechanical properties (rigidity/stiffness) of the microenvironment and how this response varies among cancer cell lines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we used a recently developed 96-well plate system that arrays extracellular matrix-conjugated polyacrylamide gels that increase in stiffness by at least 50-fold across the plate. This plate was used to determine how changes in the rigidity of the extracellular matrix modulate the biological properties of tumor cells. The cell lines tested fall into one of two categories based on their proliferation on substrates of differing stiffness: "rigidity dependent" (those which show an increase in cell growth as extracellular rigidity is increased), and "rigidity independent" (those which grow equally on both soft and stiff substrates). Cells which grew poorly on soft gels also showed decreased spreading and migration under these conditions. More importantly, seeding the cell lines into the lungs of nude mice revealed that the ability of cells to grow on soft gels in vitro correlated with their ability to grow in a soft tissue environment in vivo. The lung carcinoma line A549 responded to culture on soft gels by expressing the differentiated epithelial marker E-cadherin and decreasing the expression of the mesenchymal transcription factor Slug. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These observations suggest that the mechanical properties of the matrix environment play a significant role in regulating the proliferation and the morphological properties of cancer cells. Further, the multiwell format of the soft-plate assay is a useful and effective adjunct to established 3-dimensional cell culture models.},

Purified recombinant His6-Prk, but not a kinase-defective mutant His6-PrkK52R, is capable of strongly phosphorylating His6-Cdc25C in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation and affinity column chromatography experiments demonstrate that GST-Prk and native Cdc25C interact. When co-infected with His6-Prk and His6-Cdc25C recombinant baculoviruses, sf-9 cells produce His6-Cdc25C antigen with an additional slower mobility band on denaturing polyacrylamide gels compared with cells infected with His6-Cdc25C baculovirus alone. In addition, His6-Cdc25C immunoprecipitated from sf-9 cells co-infected with His6-Prk and His6-Cdc25C baculoviruses, but not with His6-PrkK52R and His6-Cdc25C baculoviruses, contains a greatly enhanced kinase activity that phosphorylates His6-Cdc25C in vitro. Moreover, phosphopeptide mapping shows that His6-Prk phosphorylates His6-Cdc25C at two sites in vitro and that the major phosphorylation site co-migrates with the one that is phosphorylated in vivo in asynchonized cells. Further studies reveal that His6-Prk phosphorylates Cdc25C on serine216, a residue also phosphorylated by Chk1 and Chk2. Together, these observations strongly suggest that Prk's role in mitosis is at least partly mediated through direct regulation of Cdc25C.},

  abstract = {Development of characteristic tissue patterns requires that individual cells be switched locally between different phenotypes or "fates;" while one cell may proliferate, its neighbors may differentiate or die. Recent studies have revealed that local switching between these different gene programs is controlled through interplay between soluble growth factors, insoluble extracellular matrix molecules, and mechanical forces which produce cell shape distortion. Although the precise molecular basis remains unknown, shape-dependent control of cell growth and function appears to be mediated by tension-dependent changes in the actin cytoskeleton. However, the question remains: how can a generalized physical stimulus, such as cell distortion, activate the same set of genes and signaling proteins that are triggered by molecules which bind to specific cell surface receptors. In this article, we use computer simulations based on dynamic Boolean networks to show that the different cell fates that a particular cell can exhibit may represent a preprogrammed set of common end programs or "attractors" which self-organize within the cell's regulatory networks. In this type of dynamic network model of information processing, generalized stimuli (e.g., mechanical forces) and specific molecular cues elicit signals which follow different trajectories, but eventually converge onto one of a small set of common end programs (growth, quiescence, differentiation, apoptosis, etc.). In other words, if cells use this type of information processing system, then control of cell function would involve selection of preexisting (latent) behavioral modes of the cell, rather than instruction by specific binding molecules. Importantly, the results of the computer simulation closely mimic experimental data obtained with living endothelial cells. The major implication of this finding is that current methods used for analysis of cell function that rely on characterization of linear signaling pathways or clusters of genes with common activity profiles may overlook the most critical features of cellular information processing which normally determine how signal specificity is established and maintained in living cells.},

However, the known gene regulatory interactions that form a complex network with multiple feedback loops make it increasingly difficult to design the cell reprogramming scheme because the linear regulatory pathways as schemes of causal influences upon cell lineages are inadequate for predicting the effect of transcriptional perturbation. However, sufficient information on regulatory networks is usually not available for detailed formal models. Here we demonstrate that by using the qualitatively described regulatory interactions as the basis for a coarse-grained dynamical ODE (ordinary differential equation) based model, it is possible to recapitulate the observed attractors of the exocrine and {$\beta$}, {$\delta$}, {$\alpha$} endocrine cells and to predict which gene perturbation can result in desired lineage reprogramming. Our model indicates that the constraints imposed by the incompletely elucidated regulatory network architecture suffice to build a predictive model for making informed decisions in choosing the set of transcription factors that need to be modulated for fate reprogramming.},

In particular, accumulating evidence indicates that the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway functionally interacts with multiple other cellular pathways and serves as a central node in the regulation of cell division, especially in cancer cells. Here, recent observations are highlighted that connect Hippo/YAP signaling to transcription, the basic cell-cycle machinery, and the control of cell division.

  abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) supports lung tissue architecture and physiology by providing mechanical stability and elastic recoil. Over the last several decades, it has become increasingly clear that the stiffness of the ECM governs many cellular processes, including cell-phenotype and functions during development, healing, and disease. Of all the lung ECM proteins, collagen-I is the most abundant and provides tensile strength. In many fibrotic lung diseases, the expression of collagen is increased which affects the stiffness of the surrounding environment. The goal of this study was to assess the effect on fibroblast morphology, cell death, and inflammation when exposed to 2D and 3D low (0.4 mg/mL) versus high (2.0 mg/mL) collagen-I-matrix environments that model the mechanics of the breathing lung. This study demonstrates that human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL1), grown in a 3D collagen type-I environment compared to a 2D one, do not form cells with a myofibroblast morphology, express less F-actin stress fibers, exhibit less cell death, and significantly produce less pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-8 cytokines. Exposure to mechanical strain to mimic breathing (0.2 Hz) led to the loss of HFL1 fibroblast dendritic extensions as well as F-actin stress fibers within the cell cytoskeleton, but did not influence cytokine production or cell death. This dynamic assay gives researchers the ability to consider the assessment of the mechanodynamic nature of the lung ECM environment in disease-relevant models and the potential of mechano-pharmacology to identify therapeutic targets for treatment.},

  abstract = {The pulmonary extracellular matrix (ECM) determines the tissue architecture of the lung, and provides mechanical stability and elastic recoil, which are essential for physiological lung function. Biochemical and biomechanical signals initiated by the ECM direct cellular function and differentiation, and thus play a decisive role in lung development, tissue remodelling processes and maintenance of adult homeostasis. Recent proteomic studies have demonstrated that at least 150 different ECM proteins, glycosaminoglycans and modifying enzymes are expressed in the lung, and these assemble into intricate composite biomaterials. These highly insoluble assemblies of interacting ECM proteins and their glycan modifications can act as a solid phase-binding interface for hundreds of secreted proteins, which creates an information-rich signalling template for cell function and differentiation. Dynamic changes within the ECM that occur upon injury or with ageing are associated with several chronic lung diseases. In this review, we summarise the available data about the structure and function of the pulmonary ECM, and highlight changes that occur in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and lung cancer. We discuss potential mechanisms of ECM remodelling and modification, which we believe are relevant for future diagnosis and treatment of chronic lung disease.},

  abstract = {The Snail family of transcription factors has previously been implicated in the differentiation of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells (epithelial-mesenchymal transitions) during embryonic development. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions are also determinants of the progression of carcinomas, occurring concomitantly with the cellular acquisition of migratory properties following downregulation of expression of the adhesion protein E-cadherin. Here we show that mouse Snail is a strong repressor of transcription of the E-cadherin gene. Epithelial cells that ectopically express Snail adopt a fibroblastoid phenotype and acquire tumorigenic and invasive properties. Endogenous Snail protein is present in invasive mouse and human carcinoma cell lines and tumours in which E-cadherin expression has been lost. Therefore, the same molecules are used to trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transitions during embryonic development and in tumour progression. Snail may thus be considered as a marker for malignancy, opening up new avenues for the design of specific anti-invasive drugs.},

However, whether the effects of variants in this region are related to HHIP or another gene has not been proven. We confirmed genetic association of SNPs in the 4q31 COPD genome-wide association study (GWAS) region in a Polish cohort containing severe COPD cases and healthy smoking controls (P = 0.001 to 0.002). We found that HHIP expression at both mRNA and protein levels is reduced in COPD lung tissues. We identified a genomic region located {$\sim$}85 kb upstream of HHIP which contains a subset of associated SNPs, interacts with the HHIP promoter through a chromatin loop and functions as an HHIP enhancer. The COPD risk haplotype of two SNPs within this enhancer region (rs6537296A and rs1542725C) was associated with statistically significant reductions in HHIP promoter activity. Moreover, rs1542725 demonstrates differential binding to the transcription factor Sp3; the COPD-associated allele exhibits increased Sp3 binding, which is consistent with Sp3's usual function as a transcriptional repressor. Thus, increased Sp3 binding at a functional SNP within the chromosome 4q31 COPD GWAS locus leads to reduced HHIP expression and increased susceptibility to COPD through distal transcriptional regulation. Together, our findings reveal one mechanism through which SNPs upstream of the HHIP gene modulate the expression of HHIP and functionally implicate reduced HHIP gene expression in the pathogenesis of COPD.},

  abstract = {There is considerable variability in the susceptibility of smokers to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The only known genetic risk factor is severe deficiency of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, which is present in 1-2\% of individuals with COPD. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a homogenous case-control cohort from Bergen, Norway (823 COPD cases and 810 smoking controls) and evaluated the top 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the family-based International COPD Genetics Network (ICGN; 1891 Caucasian individuals from 606 pedigrees) study. The polymorphisms that showed replication were further evaluated in 389 subjects from the US National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) and 472 controls from the Normative Aging Study (NAS) and then in a fourth cohort of 949 individuals from 127 extended pedigrees from the Boston Early-Onset COPD population. Logistic regression models with adjustments of covariates were used to analyze the case-control populations. Family-based association analyses were conducted for a diagnosis of COPD and lung function in the family populations. Two SNPs at the alpha-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA 3/5) locus were identified in the genome-wide association study. They showed unambiguous replication in the ICGN family-based analysis and in the NETT case-control analysis with combined p-values of 1.48 x 10(-10), (rs8034191) and 5.74 x 10(-10) (rs1051730). Furthermore, these SNPs were significantly associated with lung function in both the ICGN and Boston Early-Onset COPD populations. The C allele of the rs8034191 SNP was estimated to have a population attributable risk for COPD of 12.2\%. The association of hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) locus on chromosome 4 was also consistently replicated, but did not reach genome-wide significance levels. Genome-wide significant association of the HHIP locus with lung function was identified in the Framingham Heart study (Wilk et al., companion article in this issue of PLoS Genetics; doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000429). The CHRNA 3/5 and the HHIP loci make a significant contribution to the risk of COPD. CHRNA3/5 is the same locus that has been implicated in the risk of lung cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The genetic risk factors for susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are still largely unknown. Additional genetic variants are likely to be identified by genome-wide association studies in larger cohorts or specific subgroups. We sought to identify risk loci for moderate to severe and severe COPD with data from several cohort studies. METHODS: We combined genome-wide association analysis data from participants in the COPDGene study (non-Hispanic white and African-American ethnic origin) and the ECLIPSE, NETT/NAS, and Norway GenKOLS studies (self-described white ethnic origin). We did analyses comparing control individuals with individuals with moderate to severe COPD and with a subset of individuals with severe COPD. Single nucleotide polymorphisms yielding a p value of less than 5\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}10(-7) in the meta-analysis at loci not previously described were genotyped in individuals from the family-based ICGN study. We combined results in a joint meta-analysis (threshold for significance p{$<$}5\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}10(-8)). FINDINGS: Analysis of 6633 individuals with moderate to severe COPD and 5704 control individuals confirmed association at three known loci: CHRNA3 (p=6{$\cdot$}38\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}10(-14)), FAM13A (p=1{$\cdot$}12\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}10(-14)), and HHIP (p=1{$\cdot$}57\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}10(-12)). We also showed significant evidence of association at a novel locus near RIN3 (p=5{$\cdot$}25\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}10(-9)). In the overall meta-analysis (ie, including data from 2859 ICGN participants), the association with RIN3 remained significant (p=5{$\cdot$}4\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}10(-9)). 3497 individuals were included in our analysis of severe COPD. The effect estimates for the loci near HHIP and CHRNA3 were significantly stronger in severe disease than in moderate to severe disease (p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}01). We also identified associations at two additional loci: MMP12 (overall joint meta-analysis p=2{$\cdot$}6\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}10(-9)) and TGFB2 (overall joint meta-analysis p=8{$\cdot$}3\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}10(-9)). INTERPRETATION: We have confirmed associations with COPD at three known loci and identified three new genome-wide significant associations.

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined by the presence of airflow limitation on spirometry, yet subjects with COPD can have marked differences in computed tomography imaging. These differences may be driven by genetic factors. We hypothesized that a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of quantitative imaging would identify loci not previously identified in analyses of COPD or spirometry. In addition, we sought to determine whether previously described genome-wide significant COPD and spirometric loci were associated with emphysema or airway phenotypes. OBJECTIVES: To identify genetic determinants of quantitative imaging phenotypes. METHODS: We performed a GWAS on two quantitative emphysema and two quantitative airway imaging phenotypes in the COPDGene (non-Hispanic white and African American), ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints), NETT (National Emphysema Treatment Trial), and GenKOLS (Genetics of COPD, Norway) studies and on percentage gas trapping in COPDGene. We also examined specific loci reported as genome-wide significant for spirometric phenotypes related to airflow limitation or COPD. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The total sample size across all cohorts was 12,031, of whom 9,338 were from COPDGene. We identified five loci associated with emphysema-related phenotypes, one with airway-related phenotypes, and two with gas trapping. These loci included previously reported associations, including the HHIP, 15q25, and AGER loci, as well as novel associations near SERPINA10 and DLC1. All previously reported COPD and a significant number of spirometric GWAS loci were at least nominally (P\,{$<$}\,0.05) associated with either emphysema or airway phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide analysis may identify novel risk factors for quantitative imaging characteristics in COPD and also identify imaging features associated with previously identified lung function loci.},

However, in vivo evidence connecting Hhip to age-related FEV1 decline and emphysema development is lacking. Herein, using Hhip heterozygous mice (Hhip(+/-)), we observed increased lung compliance and spontaneous emphysema in Hhip(+/-) mice starting at 10 mo of age. This increase was preceded by increases in oxidative stress levels in the lungs of Hhip(+/-) vs. Hhip(+/+) mice. To our knowledge, these results provide the first line of evidence that HHIP is involved in maintaining normal lung function and alveolar structures. Interestingly, antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine treatment in mice starting at age of 5 mo improved lung function and prevented emphysema development in Hhip(+/-) mice, suggesting that N-acetyl cysteine treatment limits the progression of age-related emphysema in Hhip(+/-) mice. Therefore, reduced lung function and age-related spontaneous emphysema development in Hhip(+/-) mice may be caused by increased oxidative stress levels in murine lungs as a result of haploinsufficiency of Hhip.},

However, little is known about how HHIP contributes to COPD pathogenesis. METHODS: We exposed Hhip haploinsufficient mice (Hhip (+/-) ) to cigarette smoke (CS) for 6~months to model the biological consequences caused by CS in human COPD risk-allele carriers at the HHIP locus. Gene expression profiling in murine lungs was performed followed by an integrative network inference analysis, PANDA (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation) analysis. RESULTS: We detected more severe airspace enlargement in Hhip (+/-) mice vs. wild-type littermates (Hhip (+/+) ) exposed to CS. Gene expression profiling in murine lungs suggested enhanced lymphocyte activation pathways in CS-exposed Hhip (+/-) vs. Hhip (+/+) mice, which was supported by increased numbers of lymphoid aggregates and enhanced activation of CD8+ T cells after CS-exposure in the lungs of Hhip (+/-) mice compared to Hhip (+/+) mice. Mechanistically, results from PANDA network analysis suggested a rewired and dampened Klf4 signaling network in Hhip (+/-) mice after CS exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, HHIP haploinsufficiency exaggerated CS-induced airspace enlargement, which models CS-induced emphysema in human smokers carrying COPD risk alleles at the HHIP locus. Network modeling suggested rewired lymphocyte activation signaling circuits in the HHIP haploinsufficiency state.},

In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on MCF10A cells undergoing EMT by TGF-{$\beta$}1 stimulation. Our comprehensive analysis revealed that cells progress through EMT at different paces. Using pseudotime clustering reconstruction of gene-expression profiles during EMT, we found sequential and parallel activation of EMT signaling pathways. We also observed various transitional cellular states during EMT. We identified regulatory signaling nodes that drive EMT with the expression of important microRNAs and transcription factors. Using a random circuit perturbation methodology, we demonstrate that the NOTCH signaling pathway acts as a key driver of TGF-{$\beta$}-induced EMT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gene signatures of pseudotime clusters corresponding to the intermediate hybrid EMT state are associated with poor patient outcome. Overall, this study provides insight into context-specific drivers of cancer progression and highlights the complexities of the EMT process.},

An important research topic is to identify the underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs) governing the decision making of EMT and develop predictive models based on the GRNs. The advent of recent genomic technology, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, has opened new opportunities to improve our understanding about the dynamical controls of EMT. In this article, we review three major types of computational and mathematical approaches and methods for inferring and modeling GRNs driving EMT. We emphasize (1) the bottom-up approaches, where GRNs are constructed through literature search; (2) the top-down approaches, where GRNs are derived from genome-wide sequencing data; (3) the combined top-down and bottom-up approaches, where EMT GRNs are constructed and simulated by integrating bioinformatics and mathematical modeling. We discuss the methodologies and applications of each approach and the available resources for these studies.},

  abstract = {The Hedgehog signalling pathway is essential for the development of diverse tissues during embryogenesis. Signalling is activated by binding of Hedgehog protein to the multipass membrane protein Patched (Ptc). We have now identified a novel component in the vertebrate signalling pathway, which we name Hip (for Hedgehog-interacting protein) because of its ability to bind Hedgehog proteins. Hip encodes a membrane glycoprotein that binds to all three mammalian Hedgehog proteins with an affinity comparable to that of Ptc-1. Hip-expressing cells are located next to cells that express each Hedgehog gene. Hip expression is induced by ectopic Hedgehog signalling and is lost in Hedgehog mutants. Thus, Hip, like Ptc-1, is a general transcriptional target of Hedgehog signalling. Overexpression of Hip in cartilage, where Indian hedgehog (Ihh) controls growth, leads to a shortened skeleton that resembles that seen when Ihh function is lost (B. St-Jacques, M. Hammerschmidt \& A.P.M., in preparation). Our findings support a model in which Hip attenuates Hedgehog signalling as a result of binding to Hedgehog proteins: a negative regulatory feedback loop established in this way could thus modulate the responses to any Hedgehog signal.},

This pathway consists of a series of ligands (Shh, Ihh, and Dhh), transmembrane receptors (Ptch1 and Ptch2), transcription factors (GLI1-3), and signaling regulators (SMO, HHIP, SUFU, PKA, CK1, GSK3{$\beta$}, etc.) that work in concert to repress (Ptch1, Ptch2, SUFU, PKA, CK1, GSK3{$\beta$}) or activate (Shh, Ihh, Dhh, SMO, GLI1-3) the signaling cascade. Not long after the initial discovery, dysregulation of the Hh/GLI signaling pathway was implicated in human disease. Activation of this signaling pathway is observed in many types of cancer, including basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, and many more. Most often, the activation of the Hh/GLI pathway in cancer occurs through a ligand-independent mechanism. However, in benign disease, this activation is mostly ligand-dependent. The upstream signaling component of the receptor complex, SMO, is bypassed, and the GLI family of transcription factors can be activated regardless of ligand binding. Additional mechanisms of pathway activation exist whereby the entirety of the downstream signaling pathway is bypassed, and PTCH1 promotes cell cycle progression and prevents caspase-mediated apoptosis. Throughout this review, we summarize each component of the signaling cascade, non-canonical modes of pathway activation, and the implications in human disease, including cancer.},

  abstract = {Upregulation of Patched (Ptc), the Drosophila Hedgehog (Hh) receptor in response to Hh signaling limits the range of signaling within a target field by sequestering Hh. In vertebrates, Ptch1 also exhibits ligand-dependent transcriptional activation, but mutants lacking this response show surprisingly normal early development. The identification of Hh-interacting protein 1 (Hhip1), a vertebrate-specific feedback antagonist of Hh signaling, raises the possibility of overlapping feedback controls. We addressed the significance of feedback systems in sonic hedgehog (Shh)-dependent spinal cord patterning. Mouse embryos lacking both Ptch1 and Hhip1 feedback activities exhibit severe patterning defects consistent with an increased magnitude and range of Hh signaling, and disrupted growth control. Thus, Ptc/Ptch1-dependent feedback control of Hh morphogens is conserved between flies and mice, but this role is shared in vertebrates with Hhip1. Furthermore, this feedback mechanism is crucial in generating a neural tube that contains appropriate numbers of all ventral and intermediate neuronal cell types.},

EMT can be induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in mouse NMuMG mammary epithelial cells. Here, we demonstrate a central role of helix-loop-helix factors, E2A and inhibitor of differentiation (Id) proteins, in TGF-beta-induced EMT. Epithelial cells ectopically expressing E2A adopt a fibroblastic phenotype and acquire migratory/invasive properties, concomitant with the suppression of E-cadherin expression. Id proteins interacted with E2A proteins and antagonized E2A-dependent suppression of the E-cadherin promoter. Levels of Id proteins were dramatically decreased by TGF-beta. Moreover, NMuMG cells overexpressed Id2 showed partial resistance to TGF-beta-induced EMT. Id proteins thus inhibit the action of E2A proteins on the expression of E-cadherin, but after TGF-beta stimulation, E2A proteins are present in molar excess of the Id proteins, thus over-riding their inhibitory function and leading to EMT.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by an accelerated decline in airway function with age compared to age-matched non-smokers. There is increasing evidence that this is due to small airway disease rather than from emphysema, especially in the early stages of the disease. Small airways ({$<$}2\,mm internal diameter) are narrowed in COPD with thickening and distortion of the airway wall and peribronchiolar fibrosis. In addition, loss of elasticity in alveolar attachments and mucus hypersecretion contribute to the airway narrowing and closure, leading to air trapping. The mechanisms of peribronchiolar fibrosis are poorly understood and small airway fibroblasts have not been characterised. In small airways of COPD patients the fibroblasts are profibrotic, pro-inflammatory and senescent. There is a reduction in the anti-ageing molecules sirtuin-1 and -6, which are regulated by specific microRNAs that are increased in COPD cells. It is plausible that extracellular vesicles from senescent airway epithelium transmit senescent signals to airway fibroblasts to stimulate fibrosis and inflammation. Small airways fibrosis is a target for new drug development that inhibit growth factor receptors, new antioxidants and particularly those that are targeted to mitochondria and inhibitors of cellular senescence or senolytic therapies.},

Moreover, the underlying mechanisms are discussed, including apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, biology of intestinal stem cells, alterations in the apical junctional complex, transcytotic uptake of gluten peptides, and possible implications of a defective epithelial polarity. Current research is directed toward new treatment options for CD that are alternatives or complementary therapeutics to a gluten-free diet.

Resection and transplantation are the only curative treatments available, but are greatly hampered by high recurrence rates. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) are considered to be promising anticancer agents in drug development. Currently, four HDACIs have been granted Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for cancer. HDACIs have shown significant efficacy in hematological malignancies. However, they have limited effects in epithelial cell-derived cancers, including HCC, and the mechanisms of these are not elucidated. In this study, our results demonstrated that HDACIs were able to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) in hepatoma cells which are believed to trigger tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We found that HDACIs promoted the expression of Snail and Snail-induced EMT was critical for HDACI-initiated invasion and metastasis. We indicated that HDACIs upregulated Snail in two ways. Firstly, HDACIs upregulated Snail at the transcriptional level by promoting Smad2/3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, then combined with the promoter to activate the transcription of Snail. Secondly, we showed that HDACIs regulated the stabilization of Snail via upregulating the expression of COP9 signalosome 2 (CSN2), which combined with Snail and exposed its acetylation site, then promoted acetylation of Snail, thereby inhibiting its phosphorylation and ubiquitination to repress the degradation of Snail. All these results highlighted that HDACIs have limited effects in HCC, and the use of HDACIs combined with other targeted strategies to inhibit EMT, which explored in this study is a promising treatment method for treating HCC.},

However, MMP-7 activity in regard to elastin degradation has never been quantified serologically in patients with lung diseases. An assay for the quantification of MMP-7 generated elastin fragments (ELM7) was therefore developed to investigate MMP-7 derived elastin degradation in pulmonary disorders such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and lung cancer. DESIGN AND METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies (mABs) were raised against eight carefully selected MMP-7 cleavage sites on elastin. After characterisation and validation of the mABs, one mAB targeting the ELM7 fragment was chosen. ELM7 fragment levels were assessed in serum samples from patients diagnosed with IPF (n=123, baseline samples, CTgov reg. NCT00786201), and lung cancer (n=40) and compared with age- and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: The ELM7 assay was specific towards in vitro MMP-7 degraded elastin and the ELM7 neoepitope but not towards other MMP-7 derived elastin fragments. Serum ELM7 levels were significantly increased in IPF (113\%, p{$<$}0.0001) and lung cancer (96\%, p{$<$}0.0001) compared to matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: MMP-7-generated elastin fragments can be quantified in serum and may reflect pathological lung tissue turnover in several important lung diseases.},

It has been reported to provide macrophages with the highest elastinolytic capacity and plays key roles in diseases such as emphysema and cancer. Describing the enzymatic turnover of matrix components helps to understand the molecular basis of disease processes. Hence, in this work, the cleavage behavior of MMP-7 with respect to its natural substrate human elastin was investigated using mass spectrometric (MS) techniques and molecular modeling. Elastin peptides in the range of 500-8000 Da released through the action of MMP-7 were analyzed and domains susceptible to proteolytic attack by MMP-7 were identified. MMP-7 was found to mainly cleave in N- and C-terminal regions of elastin's precursor, which involves linkages in domains encoded by exons 2, 3, 5-7, 26, and 30-33. In contrast, only few cleavages were found in the central part of the precursor and no cleavages in regions in elastin that are involved in cross-linking. MMP-7 shows a strong preference for Leu in P(1)' and also accepts Val, Gly, and Pro at this position, whereas Ala is not preferred at P(1)'. Analysis by molecular modeling revealed that not only the size of the amino acid residue in P(1)' but also the orientation of the neighboring P(1) residue and, thus, the orientation of the peptide bond that is cleaved influences the cleavage preference of MMP-7. Overall, this study provides an important insight into the degradation of human elastin by MMP-7 and may aid in the development of approaches to treat elastin-degrading diseases.},

Genes encoding two additional alpha chains (alpha4 and alpha5) have been cloned, but little is known about their expression, and their protein products have not been identified. Here we generated antisera to recombinant alpha4 and alpha5 and used them to identify authentic proteins in tissue extracts. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting showed that alpha4 and alpha5 assemble into four novel laminin heterotrimers (laminins 8-11: alpha4beta1gamma1, alpha4beta2gamma1, alpha5beta1gamma1, and alpha5beta2gamma1, respectively). Using a panel of nucleotide and antibody probes, we surveyed the expression of alpha1-5 in murine tissues. All five chains were expressed in both embryos and adults, but each was distributed in a distinct pattern at both RNA and protein levels. Overall, alpha4 and alpha5 exhibited the broadest patterns of expression, while expression of alpha1 was the most restricted. Immunohistochemical analysis of kidney, lung, and heart showed that the alpha chains were confined to extracellular matrix and, with few exceptions, to BLs. All developing and adult BLs examined contained at least one alpha chain, all alpha chains were present in multiple BLs, and some BLs contained two or three alpha chains. Detailed analysis of developing kidney revealed that some individual BLs, including those of the tubule and glomerulus, changed in laminin chain composition as they matured, expressing up to three different alpha chains and two different beta chains in an elaborate and dynamic progression. Interspecific backcross mapping of the five alpha chain genes revealed that they are distributed on four mouse chromosomes. Finally, we identified a novel full-length alpha3 isoform encoded by the Lama3 gene, which was previously believed to encode only truncated chains. Together, these results reveal remarkable diversity in BL composition and complexity in BL development.},

An unexplored aspect of this disease is the gradual remodeling of the extracellular matrix in affected nerves. To elucidate the mechanism responsible for these changes, the levels of the extracellular matrix molecules laminin, collagen IV, and fibronectin were determined. In TrJ nerves, laminin is modestly increased while full-length forms of collagen IV and fibronectin are decreased. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known to degrade multiple matrix molecules; therefore, nerves were assayed for MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins. In neuropathy nerves, elevated levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were detected on western blots, and gelatin zymography confirmed the up-regulation of gelatinalytic activity in affected samples. Immunostaining studies revealed an increase in the numbers of MMP-2- and MMP-9-expressing cells in TrJ nerves. Cell type-specific immunolabeling showed that infiltrating macrophages are a significant source of both MMP-2 and MMP-9. Finally, the degradation of exogenous collagen IV by TrJ nerve lysates was prevented with a specific MMP inhibitor. Together these observations suggest that infiltration by MMP-expressing macrophages contributes to the remodeling of the TrJ nerve matrix.},

  abstract = {Four decades have passed since the first discovery of collagen IV by Kefalides in 1966. Since then collagen IV has been investigated extensively by a large number of research laboratories around the world. Advances in molecular genetics have resulted in identification of six evolutionary related mammalian genes encoding six different polypeptide chains of collagen IV. The genes are differentially expressed during the embryonic development, providing different tissues with specific collagen IV networks each having unique biochemical properties. Newly translated alpha-chains interact and assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum in a chain-specific fashion and form unique heterotrimers. Unlike most collagens, type IV collagen is an exclusive member of the basement membranes and through a complex inter- and intramolecular interactions form supramolecular networks that influence cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Collagen IV is directly involved in a number of genetic and acquired disease such as Alport's and Goodpasture's syndromes. Recent discoveries have also highlighted a new and direct role for collagen IV in the development of rare genetic diseases such as cerebral hemorrhage and porencephaly in infants and hemorrhagic stroke in adults. Years of intensive investigations have resulted in a vast body of information about the structure, function, and biology of collagen IV. In this review article, we will summarize essential findings on the structural and functional relationships of different collagen IV chains and their roles in health and disease.},

  abstract = {Loss of E-cadherin expression is a major characteristic of highly invasive and metastatic cancers. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been advocated to be a causative mechanism for the suppression of E-cadherin and tumor progression. Snail is a zinc finger transcription factor that triggers the EMT and is one of the recently identified E-cadherin repressors. The reverse correlation of Snail and E-cadherin expressions has been reported in many types of human cancers including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In this study, we showed that three E-cadherin negative SCC cell lines had a fibroblastic morphology, strong expressions of vimentin, a mesenchymal marker gene, and Snail. Compared to other E-cadherin positive SCC cells, these cells showed higher invasive ability and expression of MMP-2, a matrix degrading enzyme which has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in invasive cancer cells. Over-expression of Snail in A431 cells resulted in the loss of E-cadherin expression, the change of their morphology to fibroblastic, and the up-regulation of vimentin gene expression, indicating that an EMT was induced by Snail. Furthermore, these cells became more invasive and showed higher levels of MMP-2 activity and its gene expression. Luciferase analysis demonstrated that the MMP-2 promoter activity was induced by Snail transfection and the promoter region from -262 to -411 relative to the transcriptional start site was necessary for this induction. These results indicate that Snail is a new inducer of MMP-2 expression and suggest that the EMT contributes to the increased invasion not only through the inhibition of cell-cell adhesion but also the up-regulation of MMP-2 expression in SCC cells.},

  abstract = {Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, the precise molecular mechanisms that give rise to lung cancer are incompletely understood. Here, we show that HMGA1 is an important oncogene that drives transformation in undifferentiated, large-cell carcinoma. First, we show that the HMGA1 gene is overexpressed in lung cancer cell lines and primary human lung tumors. Forced overexpression of HMGA1 induces a transformed phenotype with anchorage-independent cell growth in cultured lung cells derived from normal tissue. Conversely, inhibiting HMGA1 expression blocks anchorage-independent cell growth in the H1299 metastatic, undifferentiated, large-cell human lung carcinoma cells. We also show that the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) gene is a downstream target upregulated by HMGA1 in large-cell carcinoma cells. In chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, HMGA1 binds directly to the MMP-2 promoter in vivo in large-cell lung cancer cells, but not in squamous cell carcinoma cells. In large-cell carcinoma cell lines, there is a significant, positive correlation between HMGA1 and MMP-2 mRNA. Moreover, interfering with MMP-2 expression blocks anchorage-independent cell growth in H1299 large-cell carcinoma cells, indicating that the HMGA1-MMP-2 pathway is required for this transformation phenotype in these cells. Blocking MMP-2 expression also inhibits migration and invasion in the H1299 large-cell carcinoma cells. Our findings suggest an important role for MMP-2 in transformation mediated by HMGA1 in large-cell, undifferentiated lung carcinoma and support the development of strategies to target this pathway in selected tumors.},

Here, we found that zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) was overexpressed in several colorectal cancer cell lines and colorectal cancer specimens relative to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Although ZEB2 has been reported to be associated with several tumors, its involvement in colorectal cancer progression remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of ZEB2 underlying colorectal carcinoma metastasis and angiogenesis. HCT116 colorectal cancer cells were treated with ZEB2 shRNA or recombinant ZEB2, and the expression of ZEB2 was assessed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting, respectively. Ectopic expression of ZEB2 induced proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and increased the metastatic capacity of HCT116 cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, endothelial cell tube formation and angiogenesis in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) were accelerated by conditioned medium from ZEB2-overexpressing HCT116 cells. Further, overexpression of ZEB2 accelerated tumor growth and angiogenesis in xenotransplantation models. However, silencing endogenous ZEB2 caused an opposite outcome. Our results provide new evidence that ZEB2 promotes the progression of colon cancer, and thereby might represent a novel therapeutic target for colorectal carcinoma.},

We identified C/EBP{$\alpha$} as one of the most TGF-{$\beta$}-mediated downregulated transcription factors in human mammary epithelial cells. C/EBP{$\alpha$} expression prevents TGF-{$\beta$}-driven EMT by inhibiting expression of known EMT factors. Depletion of C/EBP{$\alpha$} is sufficient to induce mesenchymal-like morphology and molecular features, while cells that had undergone TGF-{$\beta$}-induced EMT reverted to an epithelial-like state upon C/EBP{$\alpha$} re-expression. In vivo, mice injected with C/EBP{$\alpha$}-expressing breast tumor organoids display a dramatic reduction of metastatic lesions. Collectively, our results show that C/EBP{$\alpha$} is required for maintaining epithelial homeostasis by repressing the expression of key mesenchymal markers, thereby preventing EMT-mediated tumorigenesis. These data suggest that C/EBP{$\alpha$} is a master epithelial "gatekeeper" whose expression is required to prevent unwarranted mesenchymal transition, supporting an important role for EMT in mediating breast cancer metastasis.},

We showed previously that matrilysin is a target gene of beta-catenin-Tcf, the transcription factor complex whose activity is thought to play a crucial role in the initiation of intestinal tumorigenesis. Here we report that overexpression of a stable mutant form of beta-catenin alone was not sufficient to effect expression of luciferase from a matrilysin promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid. However, cotransfection of the reporter with an expression vector encoding the PEA3 Ets transcription factor, or its close relatives ER81 and ERM, increased luciferase expression and rendered the promoter responsive to beta-catenin-LEF-1 as well as to the AP-1 protein c-Jun. Other Ets proteins could not substitute for the PEA3 subfamily. Luciferase activity was induced up to 250-fold when PEA3, c-Jun, beta-catenin, and LEF-1 were coexpressed. This combination of transcription factors was also sufficient to induce expression of the endogenous matrilysin gene. Furthermore, all matrilysin-expressing benign intestinal tumors of the Min mouse expressed a member of the PEA3 subfamily, as did all human colon tumor cell lines examined. These data suggest that the expression of members of the PEA3 subfamily, in conjunction with the accumulation of beta-catenin in these tumors, leads to coordinate upregulation of matrilysin gene transcription, contributing to gastrointestinal tumorigenesis.},

In the present study, we investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during ovarian endometriosis ( N = 40) progression. We found that the expressions of EMT markers such as vimentin, slug, and N-cadherin were significantly elevated in late stages of ovarian endometriosis compared with those found in early stages. In addition, the activity and expression of ectopic MMP-7 were significantly higher in the late stages of endometriosis. In vitro studies revealed that increased expression of MMP-7 as well as epidermal growth factor (EGF), which was significantly elevated in severe stages of ovarian endometriosis, induced EMT in endocervical epithelial cells (End1/E6E7). Silencing the MMP-7 transcripts using small interfering RNA attenuated EMT responses, whereas treatment with recombinant active MMP-7 promoted EMT by cleaving E-cadherin. In addition, EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitor treatments regressed endometriotic lesions and decreased MMP-7 activities in a mouse model of endometriosis.

Inhibiting ERK1/2 signaling, but not PI3-kinase signaling, blocked TGF-beta1-induced Slug expression in the malignant UMSCC1 cells. To further examine the role of Slug in OSCC progression, we generated UMSCC1 cells with inducible expression of Slug protein. Induction of Slug in UMSCC1 cells did not repress E-cadherin levels or regulate individual movement of UMSCC1 cells. Instead, Slug enhanced cohort migration and Matrigel invasion by UMSCC1 cells. Slug increased MMP-9 levels and MMP-9-specific siRNA blocked Slug-induced Matrigel invasion. Interestingly, Slug-specific siRNA attenuated TGF-beta1-induced MMP-9 expression and Matrigel invasion. These data demonstrate that TGF-beta1 increases Slug via ERK1/2 signaling, and thereby contributes to OSCC progression.},

Herein, we investigated how Snail upregulated transcription of ZEB1 and MMP9 induced by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in hepatoma cell HepG2. According to deletion mapping and site directed mutagenesis analysis, the TPA-responsive elements on both MMP9 and ZEB1 promoters locate on a putative EGR1 and SP1 overlapping region coupled with an upstream proposed Snail binding motif TCACA. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed TPA triggered binding of Snail, EGR1 and SP1 on MMP9 and ZEB1 promoters. Double ChIP further indicated TPA induced association of Snail with EGR1 and SP1 on both promoters. Also, electrophoresis mobility shift assay revealed TPA enhanced binding of Snail with a MMP9 promoter fragment. According to shRNA techniques, Snail was essential for gene expression of both ZEB1 and MMP9. In conclusion, Snail transactivates genes involved in tumor progression via direct binding to a specific promoter region.},

  abstract = {Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which is the most common malignancy of the oral cavity, is often associated with local and regional invasion. Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is correlated with invasive behavior of OSCC. Because transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is up-regulated in OSCC tumors, we examined the relationship between TGF-beta1 signaling and MMP-9 in human OSCC specimens. Evaluation of human specimens showed that tumors with enhanced TGF-beta1 signaling also showed increased MMP-9 expression. Because the transcription factor Snail has been determined to be a key mediator of TGF-beta1 signaling, we evaluated the role of Snail in TGF-beta1-mediated MMP-9 expression. Initially, we examined the extent to which TGF-beta1 regulated Snail expression in oral keratinocytes and in OSCC cell lines. TGF-beta1 enhanced Snail expression in a majority of the cell lines examined, with the largest induction of Snail detected in UMSCC1 cells. Interestingly, overexpression of Snail in UMSCC1 cells enhanced MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 protein levels. Despite the increase in the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 protein, there was a net increase in the pericellular proteolytic activity as shown by enhanced MMP-9-dependent Matrigel invasion. Moreover, Snail-specific siRNA blocked TGF-beta1-induced MMP-9 expression and Matrigel invasion. In addition, Snail increased Ets-1 levels and Ets-1-specific siRNA blocked both Snail- and TGF-beta1-mediated MMP-9 expression and Matrigel invasion. Thus, these data show that Snail functions as a molecular mediator of TGF-beta1-regulated MMP-9 expression by increasing Ets-1 and thereby contributing to oral cancer progression.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Transcription factor C/EBP-{$\alpha$} (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha) acts as a master regulator of hepatic and myeloid functions and multiple oncogenic processes. MTL-CEBPA is a first-in-class small activating RNA oligonucleotide drug that upregulates C/EBP-{$\alpha$}. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial of MTL-CEBPA in adults with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cirrhosis, or resulting from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or with liver metastases. Patients received intravenous MTL-CEBPA once a week for 3 weeks followed by a rest period of 1 week per treatment cycle in the dose-escalation phase (3+3 design). RESULTS: Thirty-eight participants have been treated across six dose levels (28-160 mg/m2) and three dosing schedules. Thirty-four patients were evaluable for safety endpoints at 28 days. MTL-CEBPA treatment-related adverse events were not associated with dose, and no maximum dose was reached across the three schedules evaluated. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in nine (24\%) patients. In 24 patients with HCC evaluable for efficacy, an objective tumor response was achieved in one patient [4\%; partial response (PR) for over 2 years] and stable disease (SD) in 12 (50\%). After discontinuation of MTL-CEBPA, seven patients were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); three patients had a complete response with one further PR and two with SD. CONCLUSIONS: MTL-CEBPA is the first saRNA in clinical trials and demonstrates an acceptable safety profile and potential synergistic efficacy with TKIs in HCC. These encouraging phase I data validate targeting of C/EBP-{$\alpha$} and have prompted MTL-CEBPA + sorafenib combination studies in HCC.},

Here, we found that zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) was overexpressed in several colorectal cancer cell lines and colorectal cancer specimens relative to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Although ZEB2 has been reported to be associated with several tumors, its involvement in colorectal cancer progression remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of ZEB2 underlying colorectal carcinoma metastasis and angiogenesis. HCT116 colorectal cancer cells were treated with ZEB2 shRNA or recombinant ZEB2, and the expression of ZEB2 was assessed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting, respectively. Ectopic expression of ZEB2 induced proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and increased the metastatic capacity of HCT116 cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, endothelial cell tube formation and angiogenesis in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) were accelerated by conditioned medium from ZEB2-overexpressing HCT116 cells. Further, overexpression of ZEB2 accelerated tumor growth and angiogenesis in xenotransplantation models. However, silencing endogenous ZEB2 caused an opposite outcome. Our results provide new evidence that ZEB2 promotes the progression of colon cancer, and thereby might represent a novel therapeutic target for colorectal carcinoma.},

  abstract = {ZEB1 is a prime element of a network of transcription factors that controls epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a reversible embryonic transdifferentiation program that allows partial or complete transition from an epithelial to a mesenchymal state. Aberrant expression of ZEB1 has been reported in a variety of human cancers, where it is generally believed to foster migration, invasion, and metastasis. Over the past few years, in vitro and in vivo observations have highlighted unsuspected intrinsic oncogenic functions of ZEB1 that impact tumorigenesis from its earliest stages. Located downstream of regulatory processes that integrate microenvironmental signals and directly implicated in feedback loops controlled by miRNAs, ZEB1 appears to be a central switch that determines cell fate. Its expression fosters malignant transformation through the mitigation of critical oncosuppressive pathways and through the conferment of stemness properties. ZEB1 is also a key determinant of cell plasticity, endowing cells with the capacity to withstand an aberrant mitogenic activity, with a profound impact on the genetic history of tumorigenesis, and to adapt to the multiple constraints encountered over the course of tumor development.

Deletion analysis of FN promoter localized the NF-kappaB-responsive region at the position between -1214 and -1126. Mutations in a putative NF-kappaB element (5(')-GAGAATTTCC-3(')) at -1180 blocked most of the p65-induced promoter activity. Electromobility shift assays showed that the expression of p65 induced the binding of the p65/p65 homodimer to the NF-kappaB site at -1180. Stably p65-expressing cells showed increase of promoter activity, FN protein, and its mRNA levels over control cells. Furthermore, treatment of cells with interleukin-1beta, a NF-kappaB-stimulating cytokine, also increased promoter activity, FN production, and mRNA levels. These results show that NF-kappaB activates FN gene expression by binding to the responsive element at -1180 as the p65/p65 homodimer in rat hepatocytes.},

In this study, we have investigated the action of gelatinase A (MMP-2) on collagen IV, the major constituent of the basement membrane. We have compared quantitatively its action on the soluble forms of collagen IV extracted with or without pepsin (from human placenta and from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm [EHS] murine sarcoma, respectively). The catalytic efficiency of MMP-2 is dramatically reduced in the case of the EHS murine sarcoma with respect to the human placenta, probably due to the much tighter packing of the network which renders very slow the speed of the rate-limiting step. We have also enquired on the role of MMP-2 domains in processing collagen IV. Addition of the isolated collagen binding domain, corresponding to the fibronectin-like domain of whole MMP-2, greatly in hibits the cleavage process, demonstrating that MMP-2 interacts with collagen type IV preferentially through its fibronectin-like domain. Conversely, the removal of the hemopexin-like domain, using only the catalytic domain of MMP-2, has only a limited effect on the catalytic efficiency toward collagen IV, indicating that the missing domain does not have great relevance for the overall mechanism. Finally, we have investigated the effect of MMP-2 proteolytic activity ex vivo. MMP-2 action negatively affects the neutrophils' migration across type IV coated membranes and this is likely related to the production of lower molecular weight fragments that impair the cellular migration.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elastin is an essential component of selected connective tissues that provides a unique physiological elasticity. Elastin may be considered a signature protein of lungs where matrix metalloprotease (MMP) -9-and -12, may be considered the signature proteases of the macrophages, which in part are responsible for tissue damage during disease progression. Thus, we hypothesized that a MMP-9/-12 generated fragment of elastin may be a relevant biochemical maker for lung diseases. METHODS: Elastin fragments were identified by mass-spectrometry and one sequence, generated by MMP-9 and -12 (ELN-441), was selected for monoclonal antibody generation and used in the development of an ELISA. Soluble and insoluble elastin from lung was cleaved in vitro and the time-dependent release of fragments was assessed in the ELN-441 assay. The release of ELN-441 in human serum from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n\,=\,10) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (n\,=\,29) were compared to healthy matched controls (n\,=\,11). RESULTS: The sequence ELN-441 was exclusively generated by MMP-9 and -12 and was time-dependently released from soluble lung elastin. ELN-441 levels were 287\% higher in patients diagnosed with COPD (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and 124\% higher in IPF patients (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) compared with controls. ELN-441 had better diagnostic value in COPD patients (AUC 97\%, p\,=\,0.001) than in IPF patients (AUC 90\%, p\,=\,0.0001). The odds ratios for differentiating controls from COPD or IPF were 24 [2.06-280] for COPD and 50 [2.64-934] for IPF. CONCLUSIONS: MMP-9 and -12 time-dependently released the ELN-441 epitope from elastin. This fragment was elevated in serum from patients with the lung diseases IPF and COPD, however these data needs to be validated in larger clinical settings.},

In the lung, ECM plays an active role in shaping cell behavior both in health and disease by virtue of the contextual clues it imparts to cells. Qualities including dimensionality, molecular composition, and intrinsic stiffness all promote normal function of the lung ECM. Alterations in composition and/or modulation of stiffness of the focally injured or diseased lung ECM microenvironment plays a part in reparative processes performed by fibroblasts. Under conditions of remodeling or in disease states, inhomogeneous stiffening (or softening) of the pathologic ECM may both precede modifications in cell behavior and be a result of disease progression. The ability of ECM to stimulate further ECM production by fibroblasts and drive disease progression has potentially significant implications for mesenchymal stromal cell-based therapies; in the setting of pathologic ECM stiffness or composition, the therapeutic intent of progenitor cells may be subverted. Taken together, current data suggest that lung ECM actively contributes to health and disease; thus, mediators of cell-ECM signaling or factors that influence ECM stiffness may represent viable therapeutic targets in many lung disorders.},

  abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides structural support and imparts a wide variety of environmental cues to cells. In the past decade, a growing body of work revealed that the mechanical properties of the ECM, commonly known as matrix stiffness, regulate the fundamental cellular processes of the lung. There is growing appreciation that mechanical interplays between cells and associated ECM are essential to maintain lung homeostasis. Dysregulation of ECM-derived mechanical signaling via altered mechanosensing and mechanotransduction pathways is associated with many common lung diseases. Matrix stiffening is a hallmark of lung fibrosis. The stiffened ECM is not merely a sequelae of lung fibrosis but can actively drive the progression of fibrotic lung disease. In this article, we provide a comprehensive view on the role of matrix stiffness in lung health and disease. We begin by summarizing the effects of matrix stiffness on the function and behavior of various lung cell types and on regulation of biomolecule activity and key physiological processes, including host immune response and cellular metabolism. We discuss the potential mechanisms by which cells probe matrix stiffness and convert mechanical signals to regulate gene expression. We highlight the factors that govern matrix stiffness and outline the role of matrix stiffness in lung development and the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. We envision targeting of deleterious matrix mechanical cues for treatment of fibrotic lung disease. Advances in technologies for matrix stiffness measurements and design of stiffness-tunable matrix substrates are also explored. {\copyright} 2022 American Physiological Society.

We investigated whether these properties affect the ability of cells to assemble a fibrillar fibronectin (FN) matrix. Analysis of matrix assembled by cells grown on FN-coated polyacrylamide gels of varying stiffnesses showed that rigid substrates stimulate FN matrix assembly and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) compared with the level of assembly and FAK signaling on softer substrates. Stimulating integrins with Mn(2+) treatment increased FN assembly on softer gels, suggesting that integrin binding is deficient on soft substrates. Guanidine hydrochloride-induced extension of the substrate-bound FN rescued assembly on soft substrates to a degree similar to that of Mn(2+) treatment and increased activation of FAK along with the initiation of assembly at FN matrix assembly sites. In contrast, increasing actin-mediated cell contractility did not rescue FN matrix assembly on soft substrates. Thus, rigidity-dependent FN matrix assembly is determined by extracellular events, namely the engagement of FN by cells and the induction of FN conformational changes. Extensibility of FN in response to substrate stiffness may serve as a mechanosensing mechanism whereby cells use pericellular FN to probe the stiffness of their environment.},

Using a nitrofen-induced CDH rat model, we previously reported that Foxa2 expression was downregulated in CDH lungs by proteomics analysis. Here, we investigate the role of miR-130a-5p/Foxa2 axis in lung development of the nitrofen-induced CDH and evaluate its potential role in vivo prenatal therapy. MAIN METHODS: Nitrofen was orally administrated on embryonic day (E) 8.5 to establish a rat CDH model, and fetal lungs were collected on E13.5, E15.5, E17.5, E19.5 and E21.5. The binding sites of miR-130a-5p on Foxa2 mRNA were identified using bioinformatics prediction software and were validated via luciferase assay. The expression levels of miR-130a-5p and Foxa2 were detected using qRT-PCR, ISH, IHC and western blotting. The role of miR-130a-5p/Foxa2 axis in CDH-associated lung development was investigated in ex vivo lung explants. KEY FINDINGS: We found that Foxa2 was downregulated in CDH lung tissues, and Foxa2 upregulating improved CDH branching morphogenesis in ex vivo lung explants. Meanwhile, we also showed that miR-130a-5p was significantly upregulated in CDH lungs and thus inversely correlated with Foxa2. Increasing miR-130a-5p abundance with mimics decreases Foxa2-driven Shh/Gli1 signaling and inhibits branching morphogenesis in ex vivo lung explants. SIGNIFICANCE: This study was the first to show that the miR-130a-5p/Foxa2 axis played a crucial role in CDH-associated pulmonary hypoplasia. These findings may provide relevant insights into the prenatal diagnosis and prenatal therapy of CDH.},

Whether their role is direct has remained unclear as they also regulate the expression of Shh, which has similar roles. We characterized the Foxa2 cis-regulatory network by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing of mDA progenitors. This identified 9160 high-quality Foxa2 binding sites associated with 5409 genes, providing mechanistic insights into Foxa2-mediated positive and negative regulatory events. Foxa2 regulates directly and positively key determinants of mDA neurons, including Lmx1a, Lmx1b, Msx1 and Ferd3l, while negatively inhibiting transcription factors expressed in ventrolateral midbrain such as Helt, Tle4, Otx1, Sox1 and Tal2. Furthermore, Foxa2 negatively regulates extrinsic and intrinsic components of the Shh signaling pathway, possibly by binding to the same enhancer regions of co-regulated genes as Gli1. Foxa2 also regulates the expression of floor plate factors that control axon trajectories around the midline of the embryo, thereby contributing to the axon guidance function of the floor plate. Finally, this study identified multiple Foxa2-regulated enhancers that are active in the floor plate of the midbrain or along the length of the embryo in mouse and chick. This work represents the first comprehensive characterization of Foxa2 targets in mDA progenitors and provides a framework for elaborating gene regulatory networks in a functionally important progenitor population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It remains unknown how patients with liver failure maintain essential albumin levels. Here, we delineate a hierarchical transcription regulatory network that ensures albumin expression under different disease conditions. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We examined albumin levels in liver tissues and serum in 157 patients, including 84 with HCC, 38 decompensated cirrhosis, and 35 acute liver failure. Even in patients with liver failure, the average serum albumin concentrations were 30.55 g/L. In healthy subjects and patients with chronic liver diseases, albumin was expressed in hepatocytes. In patients with massive hepatocyte loss, albumin was expressed in liver progenitor cells (LPCs). The albumin gene (ALB) core promoter possesses a TATA box and nucleosome-free area, which allows constitutive RNA polymerase II binding and transcription initiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4{$\alpha$}), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP{$\alpha$}), and forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) bound to the ALB enhancer. Knockdown of either of these factors reduced albumin expression in hepatocytes. FOXA2 acts as a pioneer factor to support HNF4{$\alpha$} and C/EBP{$\alpha$}. In hepatocytes lacking HNF4{$\alpha$} and C/EBP{$\alpha$} expression, FOXA2 synergized with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) to maintain albumin transcription. RAR nuclear translocation was induced by retinoic acids released by activated HSCs. In patients with massive hepatocyte loss, LPCs expressed HNF4{$\alpha$} and FOXA2. RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR analyses revealed that lack of HNF4{$\alpha$} and C/EBP{$\alpha$} in hepatocytes increased hedgehog ligand biosynthesis. Hedgehog up-regulates FOXA2 expression through glioblastoma family zinc finger 2 binding to the FOXA2 promoter in both hepatocytes and LPCs. CONCLUSIONS: A hierarchical regulatory network formed by master and pioneer transcription factors ensures essential albumin expression in various pathophysiological conditions.},

We identify putative NF-kappaB binding sites in the human Shh promoter region that specifically bind NF-kappaB complexes. Further, NF-kappaB activation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or p65 overexpression stimulates Shh promoter activity and p65 binds to Shh promoter in vivo. NF-kappaB-mediated transcriptional activation of Shh is mapped to a minimal NF-kappaB consensus site at position +139 of Shh promoter. NF-kappaB activation results in increased Shh mRNA and protein expression in vitro and, notably, also in vivo in a genetic mouse model of inducible NF-kappaB activity. Specific NF-kappaB inhibition by inhibitory NF-kappaBalpha (Ikappa-Balpha) superrepressor or p65 knockdown inhibits NF-kappaB-induced Shh promoter activation and Shh expression. NF-kappaB-mediated Shh expression promotes proliferation and confers resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Silencing of Shh prevents NF-kappaB-stimulated proliferation, while the addition of Shh rescues the proliferation defect imposed by NF-kappaB inhibition. Notably, NF-kappaB-stimulated tumor growth is significantly impaired by Shh knockdown in an in vivo model of pancreatic cancer. By demonstrating that NF-kappaB regulates Shh expression, which contributes to NF-kappaB-mediated proliferation and apoptosis resistance in vitro and in vivo, our findings have important implications to target aberrant Shh expression in human cancers.},

  abstract = {The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which functions as an organizer in embryonic development, is implicated in the development of various tumors. In pancreatic cancer, pathway activation is reported to result from aberrant expression of the ligand, sonic Hh (Shh). However, the details of the mechanisms regulating Shh expression are not yet known. We hypothesized that nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), a hallmark transcription factor in inflammatory responses, contributes to the overexpression of Shh in pancreatic cancer. In the present study, we found a close positive correlation between NF-kappaB p65 and Shh expression in surgically resected pancreas specimens, including specimens of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We showed that blockade of NF-kappaB suppressed constitutive expression of Shh mRNA in pancreatic cancer cells. Further activation of NF-kappaB by inflammatory stimuli, including interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and lipopolysaccharide, induced overexpression of Shh, resulting in activation of the Hh pathway. Overexpression of Shh induced by these stimuli was also suppressed by blockade of NF-kappaB. NF-kappaB-induced Shh expression actually activated the Hh pathway in a ligand-dependent manner and enhanced cell proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, inhibition of the Hh pathway as well as NF-kappaB suppressed the enhanced cell proliferation. Our data suggest that NF-kappaB activation is one of the mechanisms underlying Shh overexpression in pancreatic cancer and that proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells is accelerated by NF-kappaB activation in part through Shh overexpression.},

The TGF-{$\beta$} and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathways both mediate cell proliferation. Crosstalk between these pathways in cancer has recently been proposed, but the hierarchical pattern of this crosstalk remains unclear. In normal fibroblasts, a TGF-{$\beta$}-stimulating Shh pattern was observed in induced fibrosis. However, Shh pathway involvement in cyclosporine-enhanced gingival proliferation and the existence of crosstalk with the TGF-{$\beta$} pathway remain unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cyclosporine enhanced mRNA and protein levels of TGF-{$\beta$} and Shh in human gingival fibroblasts (RT-PCR and western blotting). A TGF-{$\beta$} pathway inhibitor mitigated cyclosporine-enhanced cell proliferation and an Shh pathway inhibitor attenuated cyclosporine-enhanced proliferation in fibroblasts (MTS assay and/or RT-PCR of PCNA). Exogenous TGF-{$\beta$} increased Shh expression; however, exogenous Shh did not alter TGF-{$\beta$} expression. The TGF-{$\beta$} pathway inhibitor mitigated cyclosporine-upregulated Shh expression, but the Shh pathway inhibitor did not alter cyclosporine-upregulated TGF-{$\beta$} expression. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The TGF-{$\beta$} and Shh pathways mediate cyclosporine-enhanced gingival fibroblast proliferation. Exogenous TGF-{$\beta$} increased Shh expression, and inhibition of TGF-{$\beta$} signaling abrogated the cyclosporine-induced upregulation of Shh expression; however, TGF-{$\beta$} expression appeared unchanged by enhanced or inhibited Shh signaling. This is the first study demonstrating the role of Shh in cyclosporine-enhanced gingival cell proliferation; moreover, it defines a hierarchical crosstalk pattern in which TGF-{$\beta$} regulates Shh in gingival fibroblasts. Understanding the regulation of cyclosporine-related Shh and TGF-{$\beta$} signaling and crosstalk in gingival overgrowth will clarify the mechanism of cyclosporine-induced gingival enlargement and help develop targeted therapeutics for blocking these pathways, which can be applied in pre-clinical and clinical settings.},

  abstract = {The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is activated in many cancers and is a promising target for therapeutic development. Deletions in the receptor Patched (PTCH) or activating mutations in Smoothened (SMO) have been reported in basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, but are largely absent in most tumor types. Therefore, the mechanism of pathway activation in most cancers, including hematological malignancies, remains unknown. In normal tissues, Hh pathway activation via PTCH/SMO causes an increase in the downstream transcriptional activator GLI1 and a decrease in the GLI3 transcriptional repressor (GLI3R). In this article, we confirm that the Hh pathway is active in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, this activity is largely independent of SMO. Epigenetic and gene expression analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas AML data set reveals that GLI3 expression is silenced in most AML patient samples, and the GLI3 locus is abnormally methylated. We show that GLI3R is required for the therapeutic effect of SMO antagonists in AML samples and restoration of GLI3R suppresses the growth of AML. We additionally demonstrate that GLI3R represses AML growth by downregulating AKT expression. In summary, this study provides the first evidence that GLI3R plays an essential role in SMO-independent Hh signaling in AML, and suggests that GLI3R could serve as a potential biomarker for patient selection in SMO antagonist clinical trials. Furthermore, these data support rational combinations of hypomethylating agents with SMO antagonists in clinical trials.},

A repressor form of Ci arises in the absence of Hh signalling by proteolytic cleavage of intact Ci, whereas an activator form of Ci is generated in response to the Hh signal. These different activities of Ci regulate overlapping but distinct subsets of Hh target genes. To investigate the mechanisms by which the two activities of Ci exert their opposite transcriptional effect, we dissect here the imaginal disc enhancer of the dpp gene, which responds to both activities of Ci. Within a minimal disc enhancer, we identify the DNA sequences that are necessary and sufficient for the control by Ci, show that the same sequences respond to the activator and repressor forms of Ci, and demonstrate that their activities can be replaced by a single synthetic Gli-binding site. We further show that the enhancer sequences of patched, a gene responding only to the activator form of Ci, effectively integrate also the repressor activity of Ci if placed into a dpp context. These results provide in vivo evidence against the employment of distinct binding sites for the different forms of Ci and suggest that target genes responding to only one form must have acquired distant cis-regulatory elements for their selective behavior.},

A key issue is how negative regulation of Hh signaling might contribute to generating differential responses over tens of cell diameters. In cells that respond to Hh, two proteins that are up-regulated are Patched1 (Ptch1), the Hh receptor, a general target in both invertebrate and vertebrate organisms, and Hip1, a Hh-binding protein that is vertebrate specific. To address the developmental role of Hip1 in the context of Hh signaling, we generated Hip1 mutants in the mouse. Loss of Hip1 function results in specific defects in two Hh target issues, the lung, a target of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, and the endochondral skeleton, a target of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) signaling. Hh signaling was up-regulated in Hip1 mutants, substantiating Hip1's general role in negatively regulating Hh signaling. Our studies focused on Hip1 in the lung. Here, a dynamic interaction between Hh and fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling, modulated at least in part by Hip1, controls early lung branching.},

In this study, we show, using a lung-specific conditional mouse model of C/EBPalpha deletion, that loss of C/EBPalpha in the respiratory epithelium leads to respiratory failure at birth due to an arrest in the type II alveolar cell differentiation program. This differentiation arrest results in the lack of type I alveolar cells and differentiated surfactant-secreting type II alveolar cells. In addition to showing a block in type II cell differentiation, the neonatal lungs display increased numbers of proliferating cells and decreased numbers of apoptotic cells, leading to epithelial expansion and loss of airspace. Consistent with the phenotype observed, genes associated with alveolar maturation, survival, and proliferation were differentially expressed. Taken together, these results identify C/EBPalpha as a master regulator of airway epithelial maturation and suggest that the loss of C/EBPalpha could also be an important event in the multistep process of lung tumorigenesis. Furthermore, this study indicates that exploring the C/EBPalpha pathway might have therapeutic benefits for patients with respiratory distress syndromes.},

We show that C/EBPalpha plays a crucial role in the maturation of the respiratory epithelium in late gestation, being required for the production of surfactant lipids and proteins necessary for lung function. Deletion of the Cebpa gene in respiratory epithelial cells in fetal mice caused respiratory failure at birth. Structural and biochemical maturation of the lung was delayed. Normal synthesis of surfactant lipids and proteins, including SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D, ABCA3 (a lamellar body associated protein) and FAS (precursor of fatty acid synthesis) were dependent upon expression of the C/EBPalpha in respiratory epithelial cells. Deletion of the Cebpa gene caused increased expression of Tgfb2, a growth factor that inhibits lung epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. Normal expression of C/EBPalpha required Titf1 and Foxa2, transcription factors that also play an important role in perinatal lung differentiation. C/EBPalpha participates in a transcriptional network that is required for the regulation of genes mediating perinatal lung maturation and surfactant homeostasis that is necessary for adaptation to air breathing at birth.},

In this study, we found that an activated mTOR/S6K1 pathway promotes Gli1 transcriptional activity and oncogenic function through S6K1-mediated Gli1 phosphorylation at Ser84, which releases Gli1 from its endogenous inhibitor, SuFu. Moreover, elimination of S6K1 activation by an mTOR pathway inhibitor enhances the killing effects of the HH pathway inhibitor. Together, our results established a crosstalk between the mTOR/S6K1 and HH pathways, which provides a mechanism for SMO-independent Gli1 activation and also a rationale for combination therapy for EAC.},

  abstract = {Rationale: The nuclear translocation of transcriptional factor Gli is indispensable for Hedgehog (Hh) signaling activation, whose deregulation causes cancer progressions; however, the mechanisms governing Gli nuclear translocation are poorly understood. Here, we report that the Gli translocation in response to Hh requires Rac1 activation. Methods: C3H10T1/2 cell line and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying Rac1 activity in regulation of Hh signaling transduction. Transgenic mouse strains and human medulloblastoma (MB) tissue samples were utilized to examine the role of Rac1 in Hh-directed limb bud development and MB progression. Results: We show that upon the binding of Hh to receptor Patched1 (Ptch1), receptor Smoothened (Smo) dissociates from Ptch1 and binds to Vav2, resulting in the increased phosphorylation levels of Vav2 at Y172, which further activates Rac1. The role of Rac1 is dependent on the regulation of phosphorylation levels of KIF3A at S689 and T694, which in turn affects IFT88 stability and subsequently dampens SuFu-Gli complex formation, leading to the release of Gli from the complex and the consequent translocation of Gli into the nucleus. Moreover, Vav2 phospho-Y172 levels are up-regulated in GFAP-Cre;SmoM2+/- mouse cerebellum and human Shh type MB tissues, whereas deficiency of Rac1 in mouse embryonic limb bud ectoderm (Prx1-Cre;Rac1f/f ) impedes Hh activation by disruption of Gli nuclear translocation. Conclusion: Together, our results uncover the Rac1 activation and the subsequent Gli translocation as a hitherto uncharacterized mechanism controlling Hh signaling and may provide targets for therapeutic intervention of this signaling pathway.},

  abstract = {Hedgehog (Hh) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members are involved in numerous overlapping processes during embryonic development, hair cycle, and cancer. Herein, we show that TGF-beta induces the expression of the Hh signaling molecules Gli1 and Gli2 in various human cell types, including normal fibroblasts and keratinocytes, as well as various cancer cell lines. Gli2 induction by TGF-beta is rapid, independent from Hh receptor signaling, and requires a functional Smad pathway. Gli1 expression is subsequently activated in a Gli2-dependent manner. In transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-beta1 in the skin, Gli1 and Gli2 expression is also elevated and depends on Smad3. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines resistant to Hh inhibition, pharmacologic blockade of TGF-beta signaling leads to repression of cell proliferation accompanied with a reduction in Gli2 expression. We thus identify TGF-beta as a potent transcriptional inducer of Gli transcription factors. Targeting the cooperation of Hh and TGF-beta signaling may provide new therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment.},

  abstract = {Previous studies demonstrate the initiation of colon cancers through deregulation of WNT-TCF signalling. An accepted but untested extension of this finding is that incurable metastatic colon carcinomas (CCs) universally remain WNT-TCF-dependent, prompting the search for WNT-TCF inhibitors. CCs and their stem cells also require Hedgehog (HH)-GLI1 activity, but how these pathways interact is unclear. Here we define coincident high-to-low WNT-TCF and low-to-high HH-GLI transitions in patient CCs, most strikingly in their CD133(+) stem cells, that mark the development of metastases. We find that enhanced HH-GLI mimics this transition, driving also an embryonic stem (ES)-like stemness signature and that GLI1 can be regulated by multiple CC oncogenes. The data support a model in which the metastatic transition involves the acquisition or enhancement of a more primitive ES-like phenotype, and the downregulation of the early WNT-TCF programme, driven by oncogene-regulated high GLI1 activity. Consistently, TCF blockade does not generally inhibit tumour growth; instead, it, like enhanced HH-GLI, promotes metastatic growth in vivo. Treatments for metastatic disease should therefore block HH-GLI1 but not WNT-TCF activities.},

Here we provide strong evidence of Hh-Gli signaling involvement in survival of colon cancer cells, with the main trigger of activation being deregulated GSK3{$\beta$}. Our clinical data reveals high expression levels of GSK3{$\beta$} and Gli3 in human colon cancer tissue samples, with positive correlation between GSK3{$\beta$} expression and DUKES' stage. Further experiments on colon cancer cell lines have shown that a deregulated GSK3{$\beta$} upregulates Hh-Gli signaling and positively affects colon cancer cell survival. We show that inhibition of GSK3{$\beta$} with lithium chloride enhances Gli3 processing into its repressor form, consequently downregulating Hh-Gli signaling, reducing cell proliferation and inducing cell death. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms revealed that lithium chloride enhances Gli3-SuFu-GSK3{$\beta$} complex formation leading to more efficient Gli3 cleavage and Hh-Gli signaling downregulation. This work proposes that activation of the Hh-Gli signaling pathway in colon cancer cells occurs non-canonically via deregulated GSK3{$\beta$}. Gli3 seems to be the main pathway effector, highlighting the activator potential of this transcription factor, which is highly dependent on GSK3{$\beta$} function and fine tuning of the Gli3-SuFu-GSK3{$\beta$} platform.},

  abstract = {Canonical Hedgehog (HH) signaling leads to the regulation of the GLI code: the sum of all positive and negative functions of all GLI proteins. In humans, the three GLI factors encode context-dependent activities with GLI1 being mostly an activator and GLI3 often a repressor. Modulation of GLI activity occurs at multiple levels, including by co-factors and by direct modification of GLI structure. Surprisingly, the GLI proteins, and thus the GLI code, is also regulated by multiple inputs beyond HH signaling. In normal development and homeostasis these include a multitude of signaling pathways that regulate proto-oncogenes, which boost positive GLI function, as well as tumor suppressors, which restrict positive GLI activity. In cancer, the acquisition of oncogenic mutations and the loss of tumor suppressors - the oncogenic load - regulates the GLI code toward progressively more activating states. The fine and reversible balance of GLI activating GLI(A) and GLI repressing GLI(R) states is lost in cancer. Here, the acquisition of GLI(A) levels above a given threshold is predicted to lead to advanced malignant stages. In this review we highlight the concepts of the GLI code, the oncogenic load, the context-dependency of GLI action, and different modes of signaling integration such as that of HH and EGF. Targeting the GLI code directly or indirectly promises therapeutic benefits beyond the direct blockade of individual pathways.},

Identifying Gli targets in a systematic fashion is central to the understanding of the action of Shh. We examined this issue in differentiating neural progenitors in mouse. An epitope-tagged Gli-activator protein was used to directly isolate cis-regulatory sequences by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP products were then used to screen custom genomic tiling arrays of putative Hedgehog (Hh) targets predicted from transcriptional profiling studies, surveying 50-150 kb of non-transcribed sequence for each candidate. In addition to identifying expected Gli-target sites, the data predicted a number of unreported direct targets of Shh action. Transgenic analysis of binding regions in Nkx2.2, Nkx2.1 (Titf1) and Rab34 established these as direct Hh targets. These data also facilitated the generation of an algorithm that improved in silico predictions of Hh target genes. Together, these approaches provide significant new insights into both tissue-specific and general transcriptional targets in a crucial Shh-mediated patterning process.},

Further, Gli3 binds inertly to previously identified neural-specific Gli enhancers, demonstrating the accessibility of their cis-regulatory elements. Intersection of DNA binding data with gene expression profiles predicted 205 putative limb target genes.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An intergenic region at chromosome 4q31 is one of the most significant regions associated with COPD susceptibility and lung function in GWAS. In this region, the implicated causal gene HHIP has a unique epithelial expression pattern in adult human lungs, in contrast to dominant expression in fibroblasts in murine lungs. However, the mechanism underlying the species-dependent cell type-specific regulation of HHIP remains largely unknown. METHODS: We employed snATAC-seq analysis to identify open chromatin regions within the COPD GWAS region in various human lung cell types. ChIP-quantitative PCR, reporter assays, chromatin conformation capture assays and Hi-C assays were conducted to characterize the regulatory element in this region. CRISPR/Cas9-editing was performed in BEAS-2B cells to generate single colonies with stable knockout of the regulatory element. RT-PCR and Western blot assays were used to evaluate expression of HHIP and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related marker genes. FINDINGS: We identified a distal enhancer within the COPD 4q31 GWAS locus that regulates HHIP transcription at baseline and after TGF{$\beta$} treatment in a SMAD3-dependent, but Hedgehog-independent manner in human bronchial epithelial cells. The distal enhancer also maintains chromatin topological domains near 4q31 locus and HHIP gene. Reduced HHIP expression led to increased EMT induced by TGF{$\beta$} in human bronchial epithelial cells. INTERPRETATION: A distal enhancer regulates HHIP expression both under homeostatic condition and upon TGF{$\beta$} treatment in human bronchial epithelial cells. The interaction between HHIP and TGF{$\beta$} signalling possibly contributes to COPD pathogenesis. FUNDING: Supported by NIH grants R01HL127200, R01HL148667 and R01HL162783 (to X. Z).},

We identified C/EBP{$\alpha$} as one of the most TGF-{$\beta$}-mediated downregulated transcription factors in human mammary epithelial cells. C/EBP{$\alpha$} expression prevents TGF-{$\beta$}-driven EMT by inhibiting expression of known EMT factors. Depletion of C/EBP{$\alpha$} is sufficient to induce mesenchymal-like morphology and molecular features, while cells that had undergone TGF-{$\beta$}-induced EMT reverted to an epithelial-like state upon C/EBP{$\alpha$} re-expression. In vivo, mice injected with C/EBP{$\alpha$}-expressing breast tumor organoids display a dramatic reduction of metastatic lesions. Collectively, our results show that C/EBP{$\alpha$} is required for maintaining epithelial homeostasis by repressing the expression of key mesenchymal markers, thereby preventing EMT-mediated tumorigenesis. These data suggest that C/EBP{$\alpha$} is a master epithelial "gatekeeper" whose expression is required to prevent unwarranted mesenchymal transition, supporting an important role for EMT in mediating breast cancer metastasis.},

We initiated studies in Burkitt lymphoma cells, which constitutively express c-MYC due to a chromosomal translocation, to determine whether Hedgehog or c-MYC regulates GLI1 expression. We show that all Burkitt lymphoma cell lines tested express GLI1, PTCH1, and SMO and that five of six Burkitt lymphomas express GLI1. Exposure to Sonic or Indian Hedgehog or cyclopamine (SMO inhibitor) does not modulate GLI1 expression, cell proliferation, or apoptosis in most Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. Sequence analysis of PTCH1, SMO, and SuFu failed to show mutations that might explain the lack of Hedgehog responsiveness, and we did not detect primary cilia, which may contribute to it. We show that c-MYC interacts with the 5'-regulatory region of GLI1, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, and E-box-dependent transcriptional activation of GLI1 by c-MYC in NIH3T3 and HeLa cells. The c-MYC small-molecule inhibitor 10058-F4 downregulates GLI1 mRNA and protein and reduces the viability of Burkitt lymphoma cells. Inhibition of GLI1 by GANT61 increases apoptosis and reduces viability of some Burkitt lymphoma cells. Collectively, our data provide evidence that c-MYC directly regulates GLI1 and support an antiapoptotic role for GLI1 in Burkitt lymphoma.

Gene expression profiling has revealed that transcriptional overexpression of glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1), a vital gene in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, occurs in poor-prognosis AML, and high levels of phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) and AKT3 predict shorter overall survival in AML patients. In this study, we discovered that GLI1 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and reduces chemotherapy sensitivity in AML cells while knocking down GLI1 has the opposite effect. Moreover, GLI1 promoted cell cycle progression and led to elevated protein levels of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in AML cells. By luciferase assays and co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that the PI3K/AKT pathway is directly activated by GLI1. GLI1 overexpression significantly accelerates tumor growth and upregulated p-AKT, CDK4, and cyclinD3 in vivo. Notably, the GLI1 inhibitor GANT61 and the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD 0332991 had synergistic effects in promoting Ara-c sensitivity in AML cell lines and patient samples.

Using Hmga1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in mice that endogenously express an Hmga1-GFP fusion protein, we examined Hmga1 expression in undifferentiated and differentiated populations of hematopoietic cells. During early T cell development in the thymus, Hmga1 is highly expressed in CD4/CD8-double negative (DN) cells and is transiently downregulated in CD4/CD8-double positive (DP) cells.

Interestingly, CD4/CD8 expression in DN-stage leukemic cells is induced by inhibition of Hmga1 binding to nuclear DNA or RNA interference-mediated Hmga1 knockdown. In addition, Hmga1-depleted leukemic T cells markedly diminish proliferation, with transcriptional activation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes as a direct target of Hmga1.

Here we present evidence that these two molecules act synergistically to suppress HEK293 cell proliferation by prolonging the G2/M phase. This event was accompanied by expression of p21, a potent Cdc2 kinase inhibitor. Not surprisingly, there was a concomitant decline in Cdc2 kinase activity. beta-Catenin/TCF signaling, which was downregulated by overexpression of N-cadherin, was found to inhibit transactivation of p21 gene expression. The effect of N-cadherin on cell proliferation and p21 expression was augmented by co-expression of connexin-43. Moreover, the magnitude of the connexin's effect was dependent on its ability to mediate intercellular communication. We conclude, therefore, that two major components of cell-cell interaction synergistically regulate cell cycle progression in HEK293 cells by regulating p21 expression in a beta-catenin/TCF-dependent manner.},

In the present study, we investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during ovarian endometriosis ( N = 40) progression. We found that the expressions of EMT markers such as vimentin, slug, and N-cadherin were significantly elevated in late stages of ovarian endometriosis compared with those found in early stages. In addition, the activity and expression of ectopic MMP-7 were significantly higher in the late stages of endometriosis. In vitro studies revealed that increased expression of MMP-7 as well as epidermal growth factor (EGF), which was significantly elevated in severe stages of ovarian endometriosis, induced EMT in endocervical epithelial cells (End1/E6E7). Silencing the MMP-7 transcripts using small interfering RNA attenuated EMT responses, whereas treatment with recombinant active MMP-7 promoted EMT by cleaving E-cadherin. In addition, EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitor treatments regressed endometriotic lesions and decreased MMP-7 activities in a mouse model of endometriosis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay identified EGFR-mediated ERK1 and activator protein 1 signaling for the transcriptional activation of MMP-7 in End1/E6E7 epithelial cells.-Chatterjee, K., Jana, S., DasMahapatra, P., Swarnakar, S.

It is controlled by a variety of activities combining protrusive and contractile forces, normally generated by actin filaments. Here, we summarize actin filament assembly and turnover processes, and how respective biochemical activities translate into different protrusion types engaged in migration. These actin-based plasma membrane protrusions include actin-related protein 2/3 complex-dependent structures such as lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, filopodia as well as plasma membrane blebs. We also address observed antagonisms between these protrusion types, and propose a model - also inspired by previous literature - in which a complex balance between specific Rho GTPase signaling pathways dictates the protrusion mechanism employed by cells. Furthermore, we revisit published work regarding the fascinating antagonism between Rac and Rho GTPases, and how this intricate signaling network can define cell behavior and modes of migration. Finally, we discuss how the assembly of actin filament networks can feed back onto their regulators, as exemplified for the lamellipodial factor WAVE regulatory complex, tightly controlling accumulation of this complex at specific subcellular locations as well as its turnover.},

Loss of expression reduces tumor suppressor activity and promotes genomic instability, but how this pleiotropic biomarker is regulated at the protein level is unknown. Here we show that TGF-{$\beta$} is the physiological signal that stimulates RASSF1A degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In response to TGF-{$\beta$}, RASSF1A is recruited to TGF-{$\beta$} receptor I and targeted for degradation by the co-recruited E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH. RASSF1A degradation is necessary to permit Hippo pathway effector YAP1 association with SMADs and subsequent nuclear translocation of receptor-activated SMAD2. We find that RASSF1A expression regulates TGF-{$\beta$}-induced YAP1/SMAD2 interaction and leads to SMAD2 cytoplasmic retention and inefficient transcription of TGF-{$\beta$} targets genes. Moreover, RASSF1A limits TGF-{$\beta$} induced invasion, offering a new framework~on~how RASSF1A affects YAP1 transcriptional output and elicits its tumor-suppressive function.},

Here we show that RASSF1A is a novel antagonist of protumorigenic RhoA activity. Direct interaction between the C-terminal amino acids (256-277) of RASSF1A and active GTP-RhoA was critical for this antagonism. In addition, interaction between the N-terminal amino acids (69-82) of RASSF1A and the ubiquitin E3 ligase Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) disrupted GTPase activity by facilitating Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination of GTP-RhoA. We noted that the RhoA-binding domain of RASSF1A displayed high sequence homology with Rho-binding motifs in other RhoA effectors, such as Rhotekin. As predicted on this basis, RASSF1A competed with Rhotekin to bind RhoA and to block its activation. RASSF1A mutants unable to bind RhoA or Smurf1 failed to suppress RhoA-induced tumor cell proliferation, drug resistance, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion, and metastasis. Clinically, expression levels of RASSF1A and RhoA were inversely correlated in many types of primary and metastatic tumors and tumor cell lines. Collectively, our findings showed how RASSF1A may suppress tumorigenesis by intrinsically inhibiting the tumor-promoting activity of RhoA, thereby illuminating the potential mechanistic consequences of RASSF1A inactivation in many cancers.

We show that Zeb1 binds free actin monomers and RhoA in the cytoplasm to inhibit actin polymerization, blocking cell migration and Yap1 nuclear transport. Tgfb causes turnover of the scaffold protein Rassf1a, which targets RhoA. Release of this RhoA inhibition in response to Tgfb overcomes Zeb1's block of cytoskeleton assembly and frees it for nuclear transport. A ZEB1 nuclear transport signature highlights EMT progression, identifies dedifferentiated invasive/metastatic human LUADs, and predicts survival.

Phosphorylation of the serines, located N-terminal to the DLC1 RhoGAP domain, induces strong binding of that N-terminal region to the RhoGAP domain, converting DLC1 from an open, active dimer to a closed, inactive monomer. That binding, which interferes with the interaction of RhoA-GTP with the RhoGAP domain, reduces the hydrolysis of RhoA-GTP, the binding of other DLC1 ligands, and the colocalization of DLC1 with focal adhesions and attenuates tumor suppressor activity. DLC1 is a critical AKT target in DLC1-positive cancer because AKT inhibition has potent antitumor activity in the DLC1-positive transgenic cancer model and in a DLC1-positive cancer cell line but not in an isogenic DLC1-negative cell line.},

The interface bears striking similarity to a GTPase-effector interface and involves the switch regions in RhoA and a hydrophobic patch in PRG-PH that is conserved among all Lbc RhoGEFs. The two surfaces that bind activated and nucleotide-free RhoA on PRG-DH.PH do not overlap, and a ternary complex of PRG-DH.PH bound to both forms of RhoA can be isolated by size-exclusion chromatography.

  abstract = {The monomeric Rho GTPases are essential for cellular regulation including cell architecture and movement. A direct mechanism for hormonal regulation of the RhoA-type GTPases is their modulation by the G12 and G13 proteins via RH (RGS homology) containing RhoGEFs. In addition to the interaction of the G protein {$\alpha$} subunits with the RH domain, activated RhoA also binds to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PDZRhoGEF. The latter interaction is now extended to all seven members of the homologous Lbc family of RhoGEFs which includes the RH-RhoGEFs. This is evinced by direct measurements of binding or through effects on selected signaling pathways in cells. Overexpression of these PH domains alone can block RhoA-dependent signaling in cells to various extents. Whereas activated RhoA does not modulate the intrinsic activity of the RhoGEFs, activated RhoA associated with phospholipid vesicles can facilitate increased activity of soluble RhoGEFs on vesicle-delimited substrate (RhoA-GDP). This demonstrates feasibility of the hypothesis that binding of activated RhoA to the PH domains acts as a positive feedback mechanism. This is supported by cellular studies in which mutation of this binding site on PH strongly attenuates the stimulation of RhoA observed by overexpression of five of the RhoGEF DH-PH domains. This mutation is even more dramatic in the context of full-length p115RhoGEF. The utilization of this mechanism by multiple RhoGEFs suggests that this regulatory paradigm may be a common feature in the broader family of RhoGEFs.},

However, the understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for RhoA transcription is still very limited.

Skp2 cooperates with Myc to induce RhoA transcription by recruiting Miz1 and p300 to the RhoA promoter independently of Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein containing complex (SCF)-Skp2 E3 ligase activity. Deficiency of this complex results in impairment in RhoA expression, cell migration, invasion, and breast cancer metastasis, recapitulating the phenotypes observed in RhoA knockdown, and RhoA restoration rescues the defect in cell invasion. Overexpression of the Myc-Skp2-Miz1 complex is found in metastatic human cancers and is correlated with RhoA expression. Our study provides insight into how oncogenic Skp2 and Myc coordinate to induce RhoA transcription and establishes a novel SCF-Skp2 E3-ligase-independent function for oncogenic Skp2 in transcription and cancer metastasis.},

One important branch of EGFR signaling is through activation of GTPase Rac1, which further promotes cell proliferation, survival and cancer metastasis.

Conversely, elevated Tiam1 is required for EGFR-induced tumorigenesis. In human lung adenocarcinoma and colon cancer specimens, Tiam1 expression strongly correlates with EGFR expression. We further reveal that AKT, a key downstream protein kinase of EGFR, phosphorylates Tiam1 at several consensus sites, facilitates the interaction of Tiam1 with scaffold proteins 14-3-3 and leads to an increase of Tiam1 stability. Subsequently, Tiam1 is dephosporylated and destabilized by PP2A. Together, our study identifies a bidirectional (phosphorylation and dephosphorylation) regulatory mechanism controlling Tiam1 stability and provides new insights on how EGFR signaling triggers Rac1 activation and cancer development.},

  abstract = {Gli family members mediate constitutive Hedgehog signaling in the common skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Snail/Snai1 is rapidly induced by Gli1 in vitro, and is coexpressed with Gli1 in human hair follicles and skin tumors. In the current study, we generated a dominant-negative allele of Snail, SnaZFD, composed of the zinc-finger domain and flanking sequence. In promoter-reporter assays, SnaZFD blocked the activity of wild-type Snail on the E-cadherin promoter. Snail loss-of-function mediated by SnaZFD or by one of several short hairpin RNAs inhibited transformation of RK3E epithelial cells by Gli1. Conversely, enforced expression of Snail promoted transformation in vitro by Gli1, but not by other genes that were tested, including Notch1, ErbB2, and N-Ras. As observed for Gli1, wild-type Snail repressed E-cadherin in RK3E cells and induced blebbing of the cytoplasmic membrane. Induction of a conditional Gli1 transgene in the basal keratinocytes of mouse skin led to rapid upregulation of Snail transcripts and to cell proliferation in the interfollicular epidermis. Established Gli1-induced skin lesions exhibited molecular similarities to BCC, including loss of E-cadherin. The results identify Snail as a Gli1-inducible effector of transformation in vitro, and an early Gli1-responsive gene in the skin.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: S100A13 and high mobility group A (HMGA1) are known to play essential roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of cancer. However, the correlation between S100A13 and HMGA1 during cancer progression is not yet well understood. In this study, we determined the effects of S100A13 on HMGA1 expression in thyroid cancer cells and examined the role of HMGA1 in thyroid cancer progression. METHODS: Stable ectopic S100A13 expression TT cellular proliferation was evaluated by nude mice xenografts assays. The effect of lentivirus-mediated S100A13 knockdown on thyroid cancer cellular oncogenic properties were evaluated by MTT, colony formation assays and transwell assays in TPC1 and SW579 cells. The effect of siRNA-mediated HMGA1 knockdown on thyroid cancer cellular proliferation and invasion were evaluated by MTT, colony formation assays and transwell assays. The tissue microarray was performed to investigate the correlation between S100A13 and HMGA1 expression in tumor tissues. RESULTS: The ectopic expression of S100A13 could increase tumor growth in a TT cell xenograft mouse model. Moreover, lentivirus-mediated S100A13 knockdown led to the inhibition of cellular oncogenic properties in thyroid cancer cells, and HMGA1 was found to be involved in the effect of S100A13 on thyroid cancer growth and invasion. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated HMGA1 knockdown was proved to inhibit the growth of TPC1 cells and invasive abilities of SW579 cells. Clinically, it was revealed that both S100A13 and HMGA1 showed a higher expression levels in thyroid cancer cases compared with those in matched normal thyroid cases (P = 0.007 and P = 0.000); S100A13 and HMGA1 expressions were identified to be positively correlated (P = 0.004, R = 0.316) when analyzed regardless of thyroid cancer types. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report for the association between HMGA1 and S100A13 expression in the modulation of thyroid cancer growth and invasion. Those results would provide an essential insight into the effect of S100A13 on carcinogenesis of thyroid tumor, rending S100A13 to be potential biological marker for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer.},

Using single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with high-resolution in situ hybridization to identify novel transcriptional regulators, we show that chromatin remodeler Hmga1 is highly expressed prior to specification and maintained in migrating chick neural crest cells. Temporally controlled CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockouts uncovered two distinct functions of Hmga1 in neural crest development. At the neural plate border, Hmga1 regulates Pax7-dependent neural crest lineage specification. At premigratory stages, a second role manifests where Hmga1 loss reduces cranial crest emigration from the dorsal neural tube independent of Pax7. Interestingly, this is rescued by stabilized {\ss}-catenin, thus implicating Hmga1 as a canonical Wnt activator. Together, our results show that Hmga1 functions in a bimodal manner during neural crest development to regulate specification at the neural plate border, and subsequent emigration from the neural tube via canonical Wnt signaling.},

Transduction of TBX1 decreases cell proliferation in epithelial cancer cells and Tbx1 ablation induces epithelial proliferation during palatal development. Here, we report that TBX1 regulates stem cell properties and epithelial differentiation through the transcriptional activation of microRNAs. Stable expression of TBX1 induces microRNA-200 (miR-200), whose members repress the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and induce epithelial differentiation. TBX1 rescues ZEB2-dependent transcriptional inhibition of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster, whose promoter region contains conserved overlapping cis-regulatory motifs of the ZEB-binding E-box and TBX-binding element. Consequently, TBX1 activates the expression of both miR-200 and stemness-inhibitor miR-203 to inhibit their common targets, BMI1 and ZEB2. Moreover, Tbx1 ablation affects the differentiation of the palatal epithelium and perturbs the expression of miR-200, miR-203, and their target genes. We propose that TBX1 links stem cell properties and epithelial differentiation by inducing miR-200 and miR-203. Thus, targeting of the ZEB2-miR-200 axis by TBX1 may have potential therapeutic implications in miR-200-associated tumors and cleft palate.},

This study sought to explore the mechanism of high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) in interleukin-1beta (IL-1{$\beta$})-induced OSI and inflammatory responses in primary chondrocytes. METHODS: Primary chondrocytes were cultured and treated with IL-1{$\beta$} to establish an OA-cell model. Levels of HMGA1, Jumonji domain-containing 3 (JMJD3), and ZEB1 in cells were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Cell viability, contents of tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$}, IL-6, and IL-10, reactive oxygen species level, and glutathione peroxidase activity were assessed by the cell counting kit-8 assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and assay kits. Enrichment levels of HMGA1 on the JMJD3 promoter and enrichment levels of JMJD3 and trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) on the ZEB1 promoter region were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Functional rescue experiments were performed to analyze the impact of ZEB1 and JMJD3 on IL-1{$\beta$}-induced chondrocytes. RESULTS: IL-1{$\beta$} treatment induced HMGA1 upregulation, OSI, and inflammatory responses in chondrocytes. HMGA1 downregulation reduced IL-1{$\beta$}-induced OSI and inflammatory responses in chondrocytes. Mechanically, HMGA1 was bound to the JMJD3 promoter to promote JMJD3 transcription, and JMJD3 induced demethylation of H3K27me3 on the ZEB1 promoter to promote ZEB1 transcription. Overexpression of JMJD3 or ZEB1 neutralized the protective role of silencing HMGA1 in IL-1{$\beta$}-induced chondrocytes. CONCLUSION: HMGA1 aggravated IL-1{$\beta$}-induced OSI and inflammatory responses in chondrocytes through the promotion of JMJD3 and ZEB1.},

  abstract = {Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is defined as phenotypic change of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells. EMT, allowing cellular dissociation from epithelial tissues, plays a key role in invasion and metastasis during carcinogenesis as well as in gastrulation and neurulation during embryogenesis. SNAI1/Snail, SNAI2/Slug, ZEB1/deltaEF1/ZFHX1A, ZEB2/SIP1/ZFHX1B, TWIST1/TWIST, and TWIST2/DERMO1 are representative EMT regulators. ZEB2 represses transcription of CDH1, CLDN4, CCND1, TERT, SFRP1, ALPL and miR-200b-200a-429 primary miRNA, and upregulates transcription of mesenchymal markers. ZEB2 is relatively highly expressed in brain corpus callosum and monocytes. ZEB2 is expressed in various types of human tumors, such as breast cancer, gastric cancer, and pancreatic cancer. TGFbeta, TNFalpha, IL1, AKT and hypoxia signals are involved in ZEB2 upregulation and EMT induction; however precise mechanisms of ZEB2 transcription remained unclear. Here, refined integrative genomic analyses of ZEB2 gene were carried out. ZEB2 was co-expressed with POU3F2 (BRN2) and POU3F3 (BRN1) in brain corpus callosum, spinal cord, and fetal brain, whereas ZEB2 was co-expressed with POU2F2 (OCT2) in monocytes. Ets-Smad-binding CGGAGAC motif, bHLH-binding site, and POU/OCT-binding site within proximal promoter region, and NF-kappaB-binding site within intron 2 were completely conserved in human ZEB2, chimpanzee ZEB2, cow ZEB2, mouse Zeb2, rat Zeb2, and chicken zeb2 genes. In addition, HIF1alpha-binding site within proximal promoter region was conserved in mammalian ZEB2 orthologs. Consensus binding site for Hedgehog effector GLI was not identified within or adjacent to the 7-kb regions of human ZEB2 gene. TGFbeta, TNFalpha, IL1, and hypoxia signals directly upregulate ZEB2 to induce EMT, growth arrest, and senescence, whereas Hedgehog signals indirectly upregulate ZEB2 via TGFbeta. Together these facts indicate that ZEB2, occupying the crossroads of inflammation, aging and carcinogenesis, is an important target for drug discovery.},

This study aimed to investigate the potential interaction between ZEB2 and miR-637 and its downstream signaling pathway in glioma. The results revealed that ZEB2 could directly bind to the E-box elements in the miR-637 promoter and promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via miR-637 downregulation. Subsequent screening confirmed that HMGA1 was a direct target of miR-637, while miR-637 could drive the malignant phenotype of glioma by suppressing HMGA1 both in~vitro and in~vivo. Furthermore, interaction between cytoplasmic HMGA1 and vimentin was observed, and vimentin inhibition could abolish increased migration and invasion induced by HMGA1 overexpression. Both HMGA1 and vimentin were associated with an unfavorable prognosis in glioma. Additionally, upregulated HMGA1 and vimentin were found in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type and 1p/19q non-codeletion diffusely infiltrating glioma. In conclusion, we identified an oncogenic ZEB2/miR-637/HMGA1 signaling axis targeting vimentin that promotes both migration and invasion in glioma.},

Because HMGA1 is overexpressed in most cancers and has transcriptional relationships with several Wnt-responsive genes, we explored the involvement of HMGA1 in Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin/TCF-4 signalling. In adenomatous polyposis coli (APC(Min/+)) mice, we observed significant up-regulation of HMGA1 mRNA and protein in intestinal tumours when compared with normal intestinal mucosa. Conversely, restoration of Wnt signalling by the zinc induction of wild-type APC resulted in HMGA1 down-regulation in HT-29 cells. Because APC mutations are associated with mobilization of the {$\beta$}-catenin/TCF-4 transcriptional complex and subsequent activation of downstream oncogenic targets, we analyzed the 5'-flanking sequence of HMGA1 for putative TCF-4 binding elements. We identified two regions that specifically bind the {$\beta$}-catenin/TCF-4 complex in vitro and in vivo, identifying HMGA1 as an immediate target of the {$\beta$}-catenin/TCF-4 signalling pathway in colon cancer. Collectively, these findings strongly implicate Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin/TCF-4 signalling in regulating HMGA1 to further expand the extensive regulatory network affected by Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin/TCF-4 signalling.},

The zinc finger transcription factors GLI1 and GLI2 are considered mediators of the HH signal in epidermal cells, although their tumorigenic nature and their relative contribution to tumorigenesis are only poorly understood. To shed light on the respective role of these transcription factors in epidermal neoplasia, we screened for genes preferentially regulated either by GLI1 or GLI2 in human epidermal cells. We show here that expression of the key antiapoptotic factor BCL2 is predominantly activated by GLI2 compared with GLI1. Detailed promoter analysis and gel shift assays identified three GLI binding sites in the human BCL2 cis-regulatory region. We found that one of these binding sites is critical for conferring GLI2-specific activation of the human BCL2 promoter and that the selective induction of BCL2 expression depends on the zinc finger DNA binding domain of GLI2. In vivo, GLI2 and BCL2 were coexpressed in the outer root sheath of hair follicles and BCC and in plasma cells that infiltrated BCC tumor islands. On the basis of the latter observation, we analyzed plasma cell-derived tumors and found strong expression of GLI2 and BCL2 in neoplastic cells of plasmacytoma patients, implicating HH/GLI signaling in the development of plasma cell-derived malignancies. The results reveal a central role for GLI2 in activating the prosurvival factor BCL2, which may represent an important mechanism in the development or maintenance of cancers associated with inappropriate HH signaling.},

  abstract = {Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is an aggressive subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer, which generally exhibits chemoresistance. Effective therapy for OCCC is currently unavailable, requiring the development of new therapeutic strategies. ABT-263 (navitoclax), an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2/BCL-XL, has a potent ability of inducing death in cancer cells; however, the therapeutic effect of ABT-263 in OCCC remains unclear. Epithelial cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to acquire a mesenchymal phenotype, which is known to contribute to the development of resistance against therapeutic agents. In this study, we revealed that the sensitivity of OCCC cells to ABT-263 was associated with the epithelial/mesenchymal status of the cells. While the OCCC cells with an epithelial phenotype were ABT-263-sensitive, those with a mesenchymal phenotype were ABT-263-resistant, which was accompanied by an insufficient expression of the pro-apoptotic BH3 protein BIM. Mechanistically, the EMT-inducing transcription factor, ZEB1 down-regulated BIM transcription by binding to BIM promoter, resulting in resistance to ABT-263. It is noteworthy that ZEB1-associated ABT-263 resistance was overcome by an HDAC inhibitor, FK228 (romidepsin), through the up-regulation of BIM. In summary, our study provides evidence for a mechanism for ABT-263 resistance in OCCC cells as well as a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome it.},

  abstract = {The significance of biophysical modulators of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is demonstrated by experiments that document full EMT on stiff, nano-patterned substrates in the absence of biochemical induction. Yet, current models focus on biochemical triggers of EMT without addressing its mechanosensitive nature. Here, we built a Boolean model of EMT triggered by mechanosensing~- mitogen crosstalk. Our model reproduces epithelial, hybrid E/M and mesenchymal phenotypes, the role of autocrine TGF{$\beta$} signaling in maintaining mesenchymal cells in the absence of external drivers, inhibition of proliferation by TGF{$\beta$}, and its apoptotic effects on soft ECM. We offer testable predictions on the density-dependence of partial EMT, its molecular drivers, and the conflict between mitosis and hybrid E/M stability. Our model opens the door to modeling the effects of the biomechanical environment on cancer cell stemness linked to the hybrid E/M state, as well as the mutually inhibitory crosstalk between EMT and senescence.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Epithelial to mesenchymal transition occurs during embryologic development to allow tissue remodeling and is proposed to be a key step in the metastasis of epithelial-derived tumors. The miR-200 family of microRNAs plays a major role in specifying the epithelial phenotype by preventing expression of the transcription repressors, ZEB1/{$\delta$}EF1 and SIP1/ZEB2. We show here that miR-200a, miR-200b, and the related miR-429 are all encoded on a 7.5-kb polycistronic primary miRNA (pri-miR) transcript. We show that the promoter for the pri-miR is located within a 300-bp segment located 4 kb upstream of miR-200b. This promoter region is sufficient to confer expression in epithelial cells and is repressed in mesenchymal cells by ZEB1 and SIP1 through their binding to a conserved pair of ZEB-type E-box elements located proximal to the transcription start site. These findings establish a double-negative feedback loop controlling ZEB1-SIP1 and miR-200 family expression that regulates cellular phenotype and has direct relevance to the role of these factors in tumor progression.

  abstract = {Nectins, Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecules, induce the activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins, enhancing the formation of cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs) and claudin-based tight junctions. Nectins recruit and activate c-Src at the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites. c-Src then activates Cdc42 through FRG, a Cdc42-GDP/GTP exchange factor. We showed here that Rap1 small G protein was involved in the nectin-induced activation of Cdc42 and formation of AJs. Rap1 was recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites and locally activated through the c-Src-Crk-C3G signaling there. The activation of either c-Src or Rap1 alone was insufficient for and the activation of both molecules was essential for the activation of FRG. The activation of Rap1 was not necessary for the c-Src-mediated phosphorylation or recruitment of FRG. The inhibition of the Crk, C3G, or Rap1 signaling reduced the formation of AJs. These results indicate that Rap1 is activated by nectins through the c-Src-Crk-C3G signaling and involved in the nectin-induced, c-Src- and FRG-mediated activation of Cdc42 and formation of AJs.},

  abstract = {Cadherin-based cell--cell contacts are prominent sites for phosphotyrosine signaling, being enriched in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. The functional interplay between cadherin adhesion and tyrosine kinase signaling, however, is complex and incompletely understood. In this report we tested the hypothesis that cadherin adhesion activates c-Src signaling and sought to assess its impact on cadherin function. We identified c-Src as part of a cadherin-activated cell signaling pathway that is stimulated by ligation of the adhesion receptor. However, c-Src has a biphasic impact on cadherin function, exerting a positive supportive role at lower signal strengths, but inhibiting function at high signal strengths. Inhibiting c-Src under circumstances when it is activated by cadherin adhesion decreased several measures of cadherin function. This suggests that the cadherin-activated c-Src signaling pathway serves positively to support cadherin function. Finally, our data implicate PI3-kinase signaling as a target for cadherin-activated c-Src signaling that contributes to its positive impact on cadherin function. We conclude that E-cadherin signaling is an important activator of c-Src at cell--cell contacts, providing a key input into a signaling pathway where quantitative changes in signal strength may result in qualitative differences in functional outcome.},

  abstract = {The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) inhibits proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of p21 in normal and tumor cell lines results in cell cycle arrest. In contrast, ectopic expression of Myc alleviates G1 cell cycle arrest. Recent studies showed that Myc can repress p21 transcription, thereby overriding a p21-mediated cell cycle checkpoint. We found that activation of a Myc-estrogen receptor fusion protein by 4-hydroxytamoxifen in mouse cells resulted in suppression of endogenous p21 transcription. This effect was observed in the absence of de novo protein synthesis and was independent of histone deacetylase activity. In transient transfection studies, Myc effectively repressed p21 promoter constructs containing only 119 bp of sequence upstream of the transcription start site. This region contains multiple Sp1-binding sites and a potential initiator element, but no canonical Myc DNA-binding sites. Deletion of the potential initiator element does not affect repression of the p21 promoter by c-Myc. Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments demonstrate that c-Myc may form complexes with Sp1/Sp3. We found that the central region of c-Myc interacts with the zinc finger domain of Sp1. Because Sp1 is required for p21 transcription, it is possible that Myc may down-regulate p21 transcription, at least in part, by sequestering Sp1. Repression of the p21 promoter may contribute to the ability of c-Myc to promote cell proliferation.},
